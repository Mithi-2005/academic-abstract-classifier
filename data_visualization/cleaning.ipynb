Given a\\nsample D from a categorical distribution p over some domain Σ, an explicitly described distribution q\\nover Σ, some privacy parameter ε, accuracy parameter α, and requirements βI and βII for the type I and\\ntype II errors of our test, the goal is to distinguish between p = q and dTV (p, q) ≥ α.\\nWe provide theoretical bounds for the sample size |D| so that our method both satisfies (ε, 0)differential privacy, and guarantees βI and βII type I and type II errors. We show that differential\\nprivacy may come for free in some regimes of parameters, and we always beat the sample complexity\\nresulting from running the χ2 -test with noisy counts, or standard approaches such as repetition for\\nendowing non-private χ2 -style statistics with differential privacy guarantees. We experimentally compare the sample complexity of our method to that of recently proposed methods for private hypothesis\\ntesting [GLRV16, KR17].\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nHypothesis testing is the age-old problem of deciding whether observations from an unknown phenomenon\\np conform to a model q. Often p can be viewed as a distribution over some alphabet Σ, and the goal is\\nto determine, using samples from p, whether it is equal to some model distribution q or not. This type of\\ntest is the lifeblood of the scientific method and has received tremendous study in statistics since its very\\nbeginnings. Naturally, the focus has been on minimizing the number of observations from the unknown\\ndistribution p that are needed to determine, with confidence, whether p = q or p 6= q.\\nIn several fields of research and application, however, samples may contain sensitive information about\\nindividuals; consider for example, individuals participating in some clinical study of a disease that carries\\nsocial stigma. It may thus be crucial to guarantee that operating on the samples needed to test a statistical\\nhypothesis protects sensitive information about the samples. This is not at odds with the goal of hypothesis\\ntesting itself, since the latter is about verifying a property of the population p from which the samples are\\ndrawn, and not of the samples themselves.\\nWithout care, however, sensitive information about the sample might actually be divulged by statistical\\nprocessing that is improperly designed. As recently exhibited, for example, it may be possible to determine\\nwhether individuals participated in a study from data that would typically be published in genome-wide\\nassociation studies [HSR+ 08]. Motivated in part by this realization, there has been increased recent interest\\nin developing data sharing techniques which are private [JS13, USF13, YFSU14, SSB16].\\nProtecting privacy when computing on data has been extensively studied in several fields ranging from\\nstatistics to diverse branches of computer science including algorithms, cryptography, database theory, and\\nmachine learning; see, e.g., [Dal77, AW89, AA01, DN03, Dwo08, DR14] and their references. A notion of\\nprivacy proposed by theoretical computer scientists which has found a lot of traction is that of differential\\nprivacy [DMNS06]. Roughly speaking, it requires that the output of an algorithm on two neighboring\\ndatasets D and D0 that differ in the value of one element be statistically close. For a formal definition see\\nSection 2.\\nOur goal in this paper is to develop tools for privately performing statistical hypothesis testing. In\\nparticular, we are interested in studying the tradeoffs between statistical accuracy, power, significance, and\\n1\\n\\n\fprivacy in the sample size. To be precise, given samples from a categorical distribution p over some domain\\nΣ, an explicitly described distribution q over Σ, some privacy parameter ε, accuracy parameter α, and\\nrequirements βI and βII for the type I and type II errors of our test, the goal is to distinguish between\\np = q and dTV (p, q) ≥ α. We want that the output of our test be (ε, 0)-differentially private, and that the\\nprobability we make a type I or type II error be βI and βII respectively. Treating these as hard constraints,\\nwe want to minimize the number of samples that we draw from p.\\nNotice that the correctness constraint on our test pertains to whether we draw the right conclusion about\\nhow p compares to q, while the privacy constraint pertains to whether we respect the privacy of the samples\\nthat we draw from p. The pertinent question is how much the privacy constraint increases the number of\\nsamples that are needed to guarantee correctness. Our main result is that privacy may come for free in\\ncertain regimes of parameters, and has a mild cost for all regimes of parameters.\\nTo be√ precise, without privacy constraints, it is well known that identity testing can be performed\\nfrom O( α2n · log β1 ) samples, where n is the size of Σ and β = min{βI , βII }, and that this is tight [BFF+ 01,\\nPan08, VV14, ADK15]. Our main theoretical result is that, with privacy constraints, the number of samples\\nthat are needed is\\n\u0012\\n\u001a√\\n\u001b\\n\u0013\\n√\\nn\\nn\\nn1/3\\n,\\n,\\nÕ max\\n·\\nlog(1/β)\\n.\\n(1)\\nα2 α3/2 ε α5/3 ε2/3\\nOur statistical test is provided in Section 5 where the above upper bound on the number of samples that\\nit requires\\nis proven as Theorem 3. Notice that privacy comes for free when the privacy requirement ε is\\n√\\nΩ( α) – for example when ε = 10% and the required statistical accuracy is 3%.\\nThe precise constants sitting in the O(·) notation of Eq. (1) are given in the proof of Theorem 3. We\\nexperimentally verify the sample efficiency of our tests by comparing them to recently proposed private\\nstatistical tests [GLRV16, KR17], discussed in more detail shortly. Fixing a differential privacy and type I,\\ntype II error constraints, we compare how many samples are required by our and their methods to distinguish\\nbetween hypotheses that are α = 0.1 apart in total variation distance. We find that different algorithms are\\nmore efficient depending on the regime and properties desired by the analyst. Our experiments and further\\ndiscussion of the tradeoffs are presented in Section 6.\\nApproach. A standard approach to turn an algorithm differentially private is to use repetition. As already\\nmentioned above,√ absent differential privacy constraints, statistical tests have been provided that use an\\noptimal m = O( α2n · log β1 ) number of samples. A trivial way to get (ε, 0)-differential privacy using such a\\nnon-private test is to create O(1/ε) datasets, each comprising m samples from p, and run the non-private\\ntest on one of these datasets, chosen randomly. It is clear that changing the value of a single element in\\nthe combined dataset may only affect the output of the test with probability at most ε. Thus the output is\\n(ε, 0)-differentially private; see Section√3 for a proof. The issue with this approach is that the total number\\nof samples that it draws is m/ε = O( εαn2 · log β1 ), which is higher than our target. See Corollary 1.\\nA different approach towards private hypothesis testing is to look deeper into the non-private tests and try\\nto “privatize” them. The most sample-efficient tests are variations of the classical χ2 -test. They compute\\nthe number of times, Ni , that element i ∈ Σ appears in the sample and aggregate those counts using a\\nstatistic that equals, or is close to, the χ2 -divergence between the empirical distribution defined by these\\ncounts and the hypothesis distribution q. They accept q if the statistic is low and reject q if it is high, using\\nsome threshold.\\nA reasonable approach to privatize such a test is to add noise, e.g. Laplace(1/ε) noise, to each count\\nNi , before running the test. It is well known that adding Laplace(1/ε) noise to a set of counts makes them\\ndifferentially private, see Theorem 1. However, it also increases the variance of the statistic. This has been\\nnoticed empirically in recent work of [GLRV16] for the χ2 -test. We show that the variance of the optimal χ2 style test statistic significantly increases\\nif we add Laplace noise to the counts, in Section 4.1, thus increasing\\n√\\nthe sample complexity from O( n) to Ω(n3/4 ). So this route, too, seems problematic.\\nA last approach towards designing differentially private tests is to exploit the distance beween the null\\nand the alternative hypotheses. A correct test should accept the null with probability close to 1, and reject\\nan alternative that is α-far from the null with probability close to 1, but there are no requirements for\\ncorrectness when the alternative is very close to the null. We could thus try to interpolate smoothly between\\n2\\n\\n\fdatasets that we expect to see when sampling the null and datasets that we expect to see when sampling an\\nalternative that is far from the null. Rather than outputting “accept” or “reject” by merely thresholding our\\nstatistic, we would like to tune the probability that we output “reject” based on the value of our statistic, and\\nmake it so that the “reject” probability is ε-Lipschitz as a function of the dataset. Moreover, the probability\\nshould be close to 0 on datasets that we expect to see under the null and close to 1 on datasets that we\\nexpect to see under an √alternative that is α-far. As we show in Section 4.2, χ2 -style statistics have high\\nsensitivity, requiring ω( n) samples to be made appropriately Lipschitz.\\nWhile both the approach of adding noise to the counts, and that of turning the output of the test Lipschitz\\nfail in isolation, our test actually goes through by intricately combining these two approaches. It has two\\nsteps:\\n1. A filtering step, whose goal is to “reject” when p is blatantly far from q. This step is performed by\\ncomparing the counts Ni with their expectations under q, after having added Laplace(1/ε) noise to\\nthese counts. If the noisy counts deviate from their expectation, taking into account the extra variance\\nintroduced by the noise, then we can safely “reject.” Moreover, because noise was added, this step is\\ndifferentially private.\\n2. If the filtering step fails to reject, we perform a statistical step. This step just computes the χ2 -style\\nstatistic from [ADK15], without adding noise to the counts. The crucial observation is that if the\\nfiltering step does not reject, then the statistic is actually ε-Lipschitz with respect to the counts, and\\nthus the value of the statistic is still differentially private. We use the value of the statistic to determine\\nthe bias of a coin that outputs “reject.”\\nDetails of our test are given in Section 5.\\nRelated Work. Identity testing is one of the most classical problems in statistics, where it is traditionally\\ncalled hypothesis or goodness-of-fit testing, see [Pea00, Fis35, RS81, Agr12] for some classical and contemporary references. In this field, the focus is often on asymptotic analysis, where the number of samples goes to\\ninfinity, and we wish to get a grasp on their asymptotic distributions and error exponents [Agr12, TAW10].\\nIn the past twenty years, this problem has enjoyed significant interest in the theoretical computer science\\ncommunity (see, i.e., [BFF+ 01, Pan08, LRR13, VV14, ADK15, CDGR16, DK16, DDK16], and [Can15] for a\\nsurvey), where the focus has instead been on the finite sample regime, rather than asymptotics. Specifically,\\nthe goal is to minimize the number of samples required, while still remaining computationally tractable.\\nA number of recent works [WLK15, GLRV16, KR17] (and a simultaneous work, focused on independence\\ntesting [KSF17]) investigate differential privacy with the former set of goals. In particular, their algorithms\\nfocus on fixing a desired significance (type I error) and privacy requirement, and study the asymptotic\\ndistribution of the test statistics. On the other hand, we are the first work to apply differential privacy to\\nthe latter line of inquiry, where our goal is to minimize the number of samples required to ensure the desired\\nsignificance, power and privacy. As a point of comparison between these two worlds, we provide an empirical\\nevaluation of our method versus their methods.\\nThe problem of distribution estimation (rather than testing) has also recently been studied under the\\nlens of differential privacy [DHS15]. This is another classical statistics problem which has recently piqued\\nthe interest of the theoretical computer science community. We note that the techniques required for this\\nsetting are quite different from ours, as we must deal with issues that arise from very sparsely sampled data.\\n\\n2\\n\\nPreliminaries\\n\\nIn this paper, we will focus on discrete probability distributions over [n]. For a distribution p, we will use\\nthe notation pi to denote the mass p places on symbol i.\\nDefinition 1. The total variation distance between p and q is defined as\\ndTV (p, q) =\\n\\n1 X\\n|pi − qi | .\\n2\\ni∈[n]\\n\\n3\\n\\n\fDefinition 2. A randomized algorithm M with domain Nn is (ε, δ)-differentially private if for all S ⊆\\nRange(M ) and for all pairs of inputs D, D0 such that kD − D0 k1 ≤ 1:\\nPr [M (D) ∈ S] ≤ eε Pr [M (D0 ) ∈ S] + δ.\\nIf δ = 0, the guarantee is called pure differential privacy.\\nIn the context of distribution testing, the neighboring dataset definition corresponds to two datasets\\nwhere one dataset is generated from the other by removing one sample. Up to a factor of 2, this is equivalent\\nto the alternative definition where one dataset is generated from the other by arbitrarily changing one sample.\\nDefinition 3. An algorithm for the (α, βI , βII )-identity testing problem with respect to a (known) distribution\\nq takes m samples from an (unknown) distribution p and has the following guarantees:\\n• If p = q, then with probability at least 1 − βI it outputs “p = q;”\\n• If dTV (p, q) ≥ α, then with probability at least 1 − βII it outputs “p 6= q.”\\nIn particular, βI and βII are the type I and type II errors of the test. Parameter α is the radius of distinguishing accuracy. Notice that, when p satisfies neither of cases above, the algorithm’s output may be\\narbitrary.\\nWe note that if an algorithm is to satisfy both these definitions, the latter condition (the correctness\\nproperty) need only be satisfied when p falls into one of the two cases, while the former condition (the\\nprivacy property) must be satisfied for all realizations of the samples from p (and in particular, for p which\\ndo not fall into the two cases above).\\nWe recall the classical Laplace mechanism, which states that applying independent Laplace noise to a\\nset of counts is differentially private.\\nTheorem 1 (Theorem 3.6 of [DR14]). Given a set of counts N1 , . . . , Nn , the noised counts (N1 +Y1 , . . . , Nn +\\nYn ) are (ε, 0)-differentially private when the Yi ’s are i.i.d. random variables drawn from Laplace(1/ε).\\nFinally, we recall the definition of zero-concentrated differential privacy from [BS16] and its relationship\\nto differential privacy.\\nDefinition 4. A randomized algorithm M with domain Nn is ρ-zero-concentrated differentially private\\n(ρ-zCDP) if for all pairs of inputs D, D0 such that kD − D0 k1 ≤ 1 and all α ∈ (1, ∞):\\nDα (M (D)||M (D0 )) ≤ ρα,\\nwhere Dα is the α-Rényi divergence between the distribution of M (D) and M (D0 ).\\nProposition 1 (Propositions 1.3 and 1.4 of [BS16]). If a mechanism M1 satisfies (ε, 0)-differential privacy,\\np\\n2\\nthen M1 satisfies ε2 -zCDP. If a mechanism M2 satisfies ρ-zCDP, then M2 satisfies (ρ + 2 ρ log(1/δ), δ)differential privacy for any δ > 0.\\n\\n3\\n\\nA Simple Upper Bound\\n\\n\u0010√ \u0011\\nIn this section, we provide an O α2nε upper bound for the differentially private identity testing problem.\\nMore generally, we show that if an algorithm requires a dataset of size m for a decision problem, then it\\ncan be made (ε, 0)-differentially private at a multiplicative cost of 1/ε in the sample size. This is a folklore\\nresult, but we include and prove it here for completeness.\\nTheorem 2. Suppose there exists an algorithm for a decision problem P which succeeds with probability at\\nleast 1 − β and requires a dataset of size m. Then there exists an (ε, 0)-differentially private algorithm for\\nP which succeeds with probability at least 45 (1 − β) + 1/10 and requires a dataset of size O(m/ε).\\n\\n4\\n\\n\fProof. First, with probability 1/5, we flip a coin and output yes or no with equal probability. This guarantees\\nthat we have probability at least 1/10 of either outcome, which will allow us to satisfy the multiplicative\\nguarantee of differential privacy.\\nWe then draw 10/ε datasets of size m, and solve the decision problem (non-privately) for each of them.\\nFinally, we select a random one of these computations and output its outcome.\\nThe correctness follows, since we randomly choose the right answer with probability 1/10, or with probability 4/5, we solve the problem correctly with probability 1 − β. As for privacy, we note that, if we remove\\na single element of the dataset, we may only change the outcome of one of these computations. Since we\\npick a random computation, this is selected with probability ε/10, and thus the probability of any outcome\\nis additively shifted by at most ε/10. Since we know the minimum probability of any output is 1/10, this\\ngives the desired multiplicative guarantee required for (ε, 0)-differential privacy.\\n√\\nWe obtain the following corollary by noting that the tester of [ADK15] (among others) requires O( n/α2 )\\nsamples for identity testing.\\nCorollary 1. There exists an (ε, 0)-differentially private testing algorithm for the (α, βI , βII )-identity testing\\nproblem for any distribution q which requires\\n\u0013\\n\u0012√\\nn\\n· log(1/β)\\nm=O\\nεα2\\nsamples, where β = min (βI , βII ).\\n\\n4\\n\\nRoadblocks to Differentially Private Testing\\n\\nIn this section, we describe roadblocks which prevent two natural approaches to differentially private testing\\nfrom working.\\nIn Section 4.1, we show that if one simply adds Laplace noise to the empirical counts of a dataset (i.e.,\\nruns the Laplace mechanism of Theorem 1) and then attempts to run an optimal identity tester, the variance\\nof the statistic increases dramatically, and thus results in a much larger sample complexity, even for the case\\nof uniformity testing. The intuition behind this phenomenon is as follows. When performing uniformity\\ntesting in the small sample regime (when the number\\n√ of samples m is the square root of the domain size\\nn), we will see a (1 − o(1))n elements 0 times, O( n) elements 1 time, and O(1) elements 2 times. If we\\nadd Laplace(10) noise to guarantee (0.1, 0)-differential privacy, this obliterates the signal provided by these\\ncollision statistics, and thus many more samples are required before the signal prevails.\\nIn Section 4.2, we demonstrate that χ2 statistics have high sensitivity, and thus are not naturally differentially private. In other words, if we consider a χ2 statistic Z on two datasets D and D0 which differ in one\\nrecord, |Z(D) − Z(D0 )| may be quite large. This implies that methods such as rescaling this statistic and\\ninterpreting it as a probability, or applying noise to the statistic, will not be differentially private until we\\nhave taken a large number of samples.\\n\\n4.1\\n\\nA Laplaced χ2 -statistic has large variance\\n\\nProposition 2. Applying the Laplace mechanism to a dataset before applying the identity tester of [ADK15]\\nresults in a significant increase in the variance, even when considering the case of uniformity. More precisely,\\nif we consider the statistic\\nX (Ni + Yi − m/n)2 − (Ni + Yi )\\nZ 0 (D) =\\nm/n\\ni∈[n]\\n\\nwhere Ni is the number of occurrences of symbol i in the dataset D (which is of size P oisson(m)) and\\nYi ∼ Laplace(1/ε), then\\n• If p is uniform, then E[Z 0 ] =\\n\\n2n2\\nε2 m\\n\\nand Var[Z 0 ] ≥\\n\\n20n3\\nε4 m2 .\\n\\n• If p is a particular distribution which is α-far in total variation distance from uniform, then E[Z 0 ] =\\n2\\n4mα2 + ε2n\\n2m .\\n5\\n\\n\fThe variance of the statistic can be compared to that of the unnoised statistic, which is upper bounded by\\nm2 α4 . We can see that the noised statistic has larger variance until m = Ω(n3/4 ).\\nProof. First, we compute the mean of Z 0 . Note that since |D| ∼ P oisson(m), the Ni ’s will be independently\\ndistributed as P oisson(mpi ) (see, i.e., [ADK15] for additional discussion).\\n\u0015\\n\u0014X\\n(Ni + Yi − m/n)2 − (Ni + Yi )\\n0\\nE[Z ] = E\\nm/n\\ni∈[n]\\n\u0014X\\n(Ni − m/n)2 − Ni\\n=E\\nm/n\\ni∈[n]\\nX Y 2 + 2Yi (Ni − m/n) − Yi \u0015\\ni\\n+\\nm/n\\ni∈[n]\\n\\nX\\n\\n= m · χ2 (p, q) +\\n\\ni∈[n]\\n\\n2\\nε2\\n\\nm/n\\n\\n2n2\\nε2 m\\n\\n= m · χ2 (p, q) +\\n\\nIn other words, the mean is a rescaling of the χ2 distance between p and q, shifted by some constant amount.\\nWhen p = q, the χ2 -distance between p and q is 0, and the expectation is just the second term. Focus on\\nthe case where n is even, and consider p such that pi = (1 + 2α)/n if i is even, and (1 − 2α)/n otherwise.\\nThis is α-far from uniform in total variation distance. Furthermore, by direct calculation, χ2 (p, q) = 4α2 ,\\n2\\nand thus the expectation of Z 0 in this case is 4mα2 + ε2n\\n2m .\\nNext, we examine the variance of Z 0 . Let λi = mpi and λ0i = mqi = m/n. By a similar computation as\\nbefore, we have that\\nX 1 \u0014\\nVar[Z 0 ] =\\n2λ2i + 4λi (λi − λ0i )2\\nλ02\\ni∈[n] i\\n\u0015\\n20\\n1\\n0\\n2\\n+ 2 (8λi + 2(2λi − 2λi − 1) ) + 4 .\\nε\\nε\\nSince all four summands of this expression are non-negative, we have that\\nVar[Z 0 ] ≥\\n\\n20n3\\n20 X 1\\n=\\n.\\nε4\\nλ02\\nε4 m 2\\ni\\ni∈[n]\\n\\nIf we wish to use Chebyshev’s inequality to separate these two cases, we require that Var[Z 0 ] is at most\\nthe square of the mean separation.

A natural approach is to truncate this statistic\\nto the range [0, 1], interpret it as a probability and output the result of Bernoulli(Z) – if p = q, the result is\\nlikely to be 0, and if dTV (p, q) ≥ α, the result is likely to be 1. One might hope that this statistic is naturally\\nprivate. More specifically, we would like that the statistic Z has low sensitivity, and does not change much\\nif we remove a single individual. Unfortunately, this is not the case. We consider datasets D, D0 , where D0\\nis identical to D, but with one fewer occurrence of symbol i. It can be shown that the difference in Z is\\n|Z(D) − Z(D0 )| =\\n\\n2|Ni − mqi − 1|\\nm2 α2 qi\\n\\nLetting q be the uniform distribution and requiring that this is at most ε (for the sake of privacy), we have\\na constraint which is roughly of the form\\n2Ni n\\n≤ ε,\\nm2 α2\\nor that\\n\u0012√ √ \u0013\\nNi n\\nm=Ω\\n.\\nε0.5 α\\n√\\nIn particular, if Ni = nc for any c > 0, this does not achieve the desired O( n) sample complexity. One\\nmay observe that, if Ni is this large, looking at symbol i alone is sufficient to conclude p is not uniform, even\\nif the count Ni had Laplace noise added. Indeed, our main algorithm of Section 5 works in part due to our\\nformalization and quantification of this intuition.\\n\\n5\\n\\nPriv’IT: A Differentially Private Identity Tester\\n\\nIn this section, we prove our main testing upper bound:\\nTheorem 3. There exists an (ε, 0)-differentially private testing algorithm for the (α, βI , βII )-identity testing\\nproblem for any distribution q which requires\\n\u001b\\n\u0013\\n\u0012\\n\u001a√\\n√\\nn\\nn\\nn1/3\\nm = Õ max\\n,\\n,\\n· log(1/β)\\nα2 α3/2 ε α5/3 ε2/3\\nsamples, where β = min (βI , βII ).\\nThe pseudocode for this algorithm is provided in Algorithm 1. We fix the constants c1 = 1/4 and\\nc2 = 3/40. For a high-level overview of our algorithm’s approach, we refer the reader to the Approach\\nparagraph in Section 1.\\nProof of Theorem 3: We will prove the theorem for the case where β = 1/3, the general case follows at\\nthe cost of a multiplicative log(1/β) in the sample complexity from a standard amplification argument. To\\nbe more precise, we can consider splitting our dataset into O(log(1/β)) sub-datasets and run the β = 1/3\\ntest on each one independently. We return the majority result – since each test is correct with probability\\n≥ 2/3, correctness of the overall test follows by Chernoff bound. It remains to argue privacy – note that a\\nneighboring dataset will only result in a single sub-dataset being changed. Since we take the majority result,\\nconditioning on the result of the other sub-tests, the result on this sub-dataset will either be irrelvant to or\\nequal to the overall output. In the former case, any test is private, and in the latter case, we know that the\\nindividual test is ε-differentially private. Overall privacy follows by applying the law of total probability.\\nWe require the following two claims, which give bounds on the random variables Ni and Yi . Note that,\\ndue to the fact that we draw P oisson(m) samples, each Ni ∼ P oisson(mpi ) independently.\\n\u0010\\n\u0011\\nClaim 1. |Yi | ≤ c22ε log 1−(1−c12 )1/|A| simultaneously for all i ∈ A with probability exactly 1 − c2 .\\nProof. The survival function of the folded Laplace distribution with\\n\u0010 parameter\u0011 2/c2 ε is exp (−c2 εx/2), and\\nthe probability that a sample from it exceeding the value c22ε log 1−(1−c12 )1/|A| is equal to 1 − (1 − c2 )1/|A| .\\nThe probability that probability that it does not exceed this value is (1 − c2 )1/|A| , and since the Yi ’s are\\nindependent, the probability that none exceeds this value is 1 − c2 , as desired.\\n7\\n\\n\fAlgorithm 1 Priv’IT: A differentially private identity tester\\n1: Input: ε; an explicit distribution q; sample access to a distribution p\\n2: Define A ← {i : qi ≥ c1 α/n}, Ā ← [n] \\ A\\n3: Sample Yi ∼ Laplace(2/c2 ε) for all i ∈ A\\n\u0010\\n\u0011\\n4:\\n\\n5:\\n6:\\n7:\\n8:\\n9:\\n10:\\n11:\\n12:\\n13:\\n14:\\n15:\\n16:\\n17:\\n18:\\n19:\\n20:\\n21:\\n\\nif there exists i ∈ A such that |Yi | ≥ c22ε log 1−(1−c12 )1/|A| then\\nreturn either “p 6= q” or “p = q” with equal probability\\nend if\\nDraw a multiset S of P oisson(m) samples from p\\nLet Ni be the number of occurrences of the ith domain element in S\\nfor i ∈ A do\\n\u0011\\n\u0010\\ √\\nif |Ni + Yi − mqi | ≥ c22ε log 1−(1−c12 )1/|A| + max 4 mqi log n, log n then\\nreturn “p 6= q”\\nend if\\nend for P\\n(Ni −mqi )2 −Ni\\n2\\nZ ← mα\\n2\\ni∈A\\nmqi\\nLet T be the closest value to Z which is contained in the interval [0, 1]\\nSample b ∼ Bernoulli(T )\\nif b = 1 then\\nreturn “p 6= q”\\nelse\\nreturn “p = q”\\nend if\\n\\ √\\nClaim 2. |Ni − mpi | ≤ max 4 mpi log n, log n\\n2\\n− 1.1\\n1 − n0.84\\nn .\\n\\nsimultaneously for all i ∈ A with probability at least\\n\\nProof. We consider this in two cases. Let X be a P oisson(λ) random variable. First, assume that λ ≥\\ne−3 log n. By Bennett’s inequality, we have the following tail bound [Pol15, Can17]:\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\nx2 \u0010 x \u0011\\nPr [|X − λ| ≥ x] ≤ 2 exp − ψ\\n,\\n2λ\\nλ\\nwhere\\nψ(t) =\\n\\n(1 + t) log(1 + t) − t\\n.\\nt2 /2\\n\\n√\\nConsider x = 4 λ log n.

Here, we appeal to Proposition 1 of [Kla00], which\\nimplies the following via Stirling’s approximation:\\nPr [|X − λ| ≥ kλ] ≤\\n\\nk\\nexp(−λ + kλ − kλ log k).\\nk−1\\n\\nWe set kλ = log n, giving the upper bound\\nk\\nn1−log k ≤ 1.1 · n−2 .\\nk−1\\nWe conclude by taking a union bound over [n], with the argument for each i ∈ [n] depending on whether\\nλ = mpi is large or small.\\nWe proceed with proving the two desiderata of this algorithm, correctness and privacy.\\n8\\n\\n\fCorrectness.\\nWe use the following two properties of the statistic Z(D), which rely on the condition that\\n√\\nm = Ω( n/α2 ). The proofs of these properties are identical to the proofs of Lemma 2 and 3 in [ADK15],\\nand are omitted.\\nClaim 3. If p = q, then E[Z] = 0. If dTV (p, q) ≥ α, then E[Z] ≥ 1.\\nClaim 4. If p = q, then Var[Z] ≤ 1/1000. If dTV (p, q) ≥ α, then Var[Z] ≤ 1/1000 · E[Z]2 .\\nFirst, we note that, by Claim 1, the probability that we return in line 5 is exactly c2 . We now consider\\nthe case where p = q. We note that by Claim 2, the probability that we output “p 6= q” in line 10 is o(1),\\nand thus negligible. By Chebyshev’s inequality, we get that Z ≤ 1/10 with probability at least 9/10, and we\\noutput “p = q” with probability at least c2 /2 + (1 − c2 ) · (9/10 − c2 )2 ≥ 2/3 (note that we subtract c2 from\\n9/10 since we are conditioning on an event with probability 1 − c2 , and by union bound). Similarly, when\\ndTV (p, q) ≥ α, Chebyshev’s inequality gives that Z ≥ 9/10 with probability at least 9/10, and therefore we\\noutput “p 6= q” with probability at least 2/3.\\nPrivacy. We will prove (0, c2 ε/2)-differential privacy. By Claim 1, the probability that we return in line 5\\nis exactly c2 . Thus the minimum probability of any output of the algorithm is at least c2 /2, and therefore\\n(0, c2 ε/2)-differential privacy implies (ε, 0)-differential privacy.\\nWe first consider the possibility of rejecting in line 11. Consider two neighboring datasets D and D0 ,\\nwhich differ by 1 in the frequency of symbol i. Coupling the randomness of the Yj ’s on these two datasets,\\nthe only case in which the output differs is when Yi is such that the value of |Ni + Yi − mqi | lies on opposite\\nsides of the threshold for the two datasets. Since Ni differs by 1 in the two datasets, and the probability\\nmass assigned by the PDF of Yi to any interval of length 1 is at most c2 ε/4, the probability that the outputs\\ndiffer is at most c2 ε/4. Therefore, this step is (0, c2 ε/4)-differentially private.\\nWe next consider the value of Z for two neighboring datasets D and D0 , where D0 has one fewer occurrence\\nof symbol i. We only consider the case where we have not already returned in line 11, as otherwise the value\\nof Z is irrelevant for determining the output of the algorithm.\\nZ(D) − Z(D0 )\\n\u0014\\n\u0015\\n(Ni − mqi )2 − Ni\\n(Ni − 1 − mqi )2 − (Ni − 1)\\n1\\n−\\n=\\nmα2\\nmqi\\nmqi\\n\u0014\\n\u0015\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n(Ni − mqi ) − Ni\\n(Ni − mqi ) − 2(Ni − mqi ) + 1 − Ni + 1\\n=\\n−\\nmα2\\nmqi\\nmqi\\n2(Ni − mqi − 1)\\n.\\n=\\nm2 α2 qi\\nSince we did not return in line 11,\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\nn p\\no\\n1\\n4\\nlog\\n+\\nmax\\n4\\nmq\\nlog\\nn,\\nlog\\nn\\n|Ni − mqi | ≤\\ni\\nc2 ε\\n1 − (1 − c2 )1/n\\nn p\\no\\n4 log(n/c2 )\\n≤\\n+ max 4 mqi log n, log n\\nc2 ε\\nThis implies that\\n2|Ni − mqi − 1|\\nm2 α 2 qi\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\np\\n2\\n6 log(n/c2 )\\n≤ 2 2\\n+ 4 mqi log n .\\nm α qi\\nc2 ε\\n\\n|Z(D) − Z(D0 )| =\\n\\nWe will enforce that each of these terms are at most c2 ε/8.\\ns\\np\\nn log(n/c2 )\\n12 log(n/c2 )\\nc2 ε\\n96\\n≤\\n⇒m≥\\nm2 α2 qi c2 ε\\n8\\nc22 c1\\nα1.5 ε\\n√\\n\u0012\\n\u00132/3\\n8 log n\\nc2 ε\\n64\\n(n log n)1/3\\n≤\\n⇒\\nm\\n≥\\n√\\n√\\nm1.5 α2 qi\\n8\\nc2 c1\\nα5/3 ε2/3\\n9\\n\\n\fSince both terms are at most c2 ε/8, this step is (0, c2 ε/4)-differentially private. Combining with the\\nprevious step gives the desired (0, c2 ε/2)-differential privacy, and thus (as argued at the beginning of the\\nprivacy section of this proof) ε-pure differential privacy.\\n\\n6\\n\\nExperiments\\n\\nWe performed an empirical evaluation of our algorithm, Priv’IT, on synthetic datasets. All experiments\\nwere performed on a laptop computer with a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU and 8 GB of RAM.\\nSignificant discussion is required to provide a full comparison with prior work in this area, since performance\\nof the algorithms varies depending on the regime.\\nWe compared our algorithm with two recent algorithms for differentially private hypothesis testing:\\n1. The Monte Carlo Goodness of fit test with Laplace noise from [GLRV16], MCGOF;\\n2. The projected Goodness of Fit test from [KR17], zCDP-GOF.\\nWe note that we implemented a modified version of Priv’IT, which differs from Algorithm 1 in lines 14\\nto 21. In particular, we instead consider a statistic\\nZ=\\n\\nX (Ni − mqi )2 − Ni\\nmqi\\n\\ni∈A\\n\\n.\\n\\nWe add Laplace noise to Z, with scale parameter Θ(∆/ε), where ∆ is the sensitivity of Z, which guarantees\\n(ε/2, 0)-differential privacy. Then, similar to the other algorithms, we choose a threshold for this noised\\nstatistic such that we have the desired type I error. This algorithm can be analyzed to provide identical\\ntheoretical guarantees as Algorithm 1, but with the practical advantage that there are fewer parameters to\\ntune.\\nTo begin our experimental evaluation, we started with uniformity testing. Our experimental setup was\\nas follows. The algorithms were provided q as the uniform distribution over [n]. The algorithms were also\\nprovided with samples from some distribution p. This (unknown) p was q for the case p = q, or a distribution\\nwhich we call the “Paninski construction” for the case dTV (p, q) ≥ α. The Paninski construction is a\\ndistribution where half the elements of the support have mass (1 + α)/n and half have mass (1 − α)/n. We\\nuse this name for the construction\\n√ as [Pan08] showed that this example is one of the hardest to distinguish\\nfrom uniform: one requires Ω( n/α2 ) samples to (non-privately) distinguish a random permutation of this\\nconstruction from the uniform distribution. We fixed parameters ε = 0.1 and α = 0.1. In addition, recall\\nthat Proposition 1 implies that pure differential privacy (the privacy guaranteed by Priv’IT) is stronger\\nthan zCDP (the privacy guaranteed by zCDP-GOF). In particular, our guarantee of ε-pure differential privacy\\nimplies ε2 /2-zCDP. As a result, we ran zCDP-GOF with a privacy parameter of 0.005-zCDP, which is equivalent\\nto the amount of zCDP our algorithm provides. Our experiments were conducted on a number of different\\nsupport sizes n, ranging from 10 to 10600. For each n, we ran the testing algorithms with increasing sample\\nsizes m in order to discover the minimum sample size when the type I and type II errors were both empirically\\nbelow 1/3. To determine these empirical error rates, we ran all algorithms 1000 times for each n and m, and\\nrecorded the fraction of the time each algorithm was correct. As the other algorithms take a parameter βI\\nas a target type I error, we input 1/3 as this parameter.\\nThe results of our first test are provided in Figure 1. The x-axis indicates the support size, and the y-axis\\nindicates the minimum number of samples required. We plot three lines, which demonstrate the empirical\\nnumber of samples required to obtain 1/3 type I and type II error for the different algorithms. We can see\\nthat in this case, zCDP-GOF is the most statistically efficient, followed by MCGOF and Priv’IT.\\nTo explain this difference in statistical efficiency, we note that the theoretical guarantees of Priv’IT\\nimply that it performs well even when data is sparsely sampled. More precisely, one of the benefits of our\\ntester is that it can reduce the variance induced by elements whose expected number of occurrences is less\\nthan 1. Since none of these testers reach this regime (i.e., even zCDP-GOF at n = 10000 expects to see each\\nelement 10 times), we do not reap the benefits of Priv’IT. Ideally, we would run these algorithms on the\\nuniform distribution at sufficiently large support sizes. However, since this is prohibitively expensive to do\\n\\n10\\n\\n\fUniformity Testing\\nPriv’IT\\nzCDP-GOF\\nMCGOF\\n\\n250000\\n\\nSample Complexity (m)\\n\\n200000\\n\\n150000\\n\\n100000\\n\\n50000\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\n2000\\n\\n4000\\n\\n6000\\nSupport Size (n)\\n\\n8000\\n\\n10000\\n\\nFigure 1: The sample complexities of Priv’IT, MCGOF, and zCDP-GOF for uniformity testing\\nwith thousands of repetitions (for any of these methods), we instead demonstrate the advantages of our\\ntester on a different distribution.\\nOur second test is conducted with q being a 2-histogram1 , where all but a vanishing fraction of the\\nprobability mass is concentrated on a small, constant fraction of the support2 . This serves as our proxy\\nfor a very large support, since now we will have elements which have a sub-constant expected number of\\noccurrences. The algorithms are provided with samples from a distribution p, which is either q or a similar\\nPaninski construction as before, where the total variation distance from q is placed on the support elements\\ncontaining non-negligible mass. We ran the test on support sizes n ranging from 10 to 6800. All other\\nparameters are the same as in the previous test.\\nThe results of our second test are provided in Figure 2. In this case, we compare Priv’IT and zCDP-GOF,\\nand note that our test is slightly better for all support sizes n, though the difference can be pronounced\\nor diminished depending on the construction of the distribution q. We found that MCGOF was incredibly\\ninefficient on this construction – even for n = 400 it required 130000 samples, which is a factor of 10 worse\\nthan zCDP-GOF on a support of size n = 6800. To explain this phenomenon, we can inspect the contribution\\nof a single domain element i to their statistic:\\n(Ni + Yi − mqi )2\\n.\\nmqi\\nY2\\n\\nIn the case where mqi \u001c 1 and p = q, this is approximately equal to mqi i . The standard deviation of this\\nterm will be of the order mq1i ε2 , which can be made arbitrarily large as mqi → 0. While zCDP-GOF may\\nnaively seem susceptible to this same pitfall, their projection method appears to elegantly avoid it.\\nAs a final test, we note that zCDP-GOF guarantees zCDP, while Priv’IT guarantees (vanilla) differen2\\ntial privacy. In our previous tests, our guarantee was ε-differential privacy, while theirs was ε2 -zCDP: by\\nProposition 1, our guarantees imply theirs. In the third test, we revisit uniformity testing, but when their\\n2\\nguarantees imply ours. More specifically, again with ε = 0.1, we ran zCDP-GOF with the guarantee of ε2 p\\n2\\nzCDP and Priv’IT with the guarantee of ( ε2 + ε 2 log(1/δ), δ) for various δ > 0. We note that δ is often\\nthought in theory to be “cryptographically small” (such as 2−100 ), but we compare with a wide range of δ,\\nboth large and small: δ = 1/et for t ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}. This test was conducted on support sizes n ranging\\nfrom 10 to 6000.\\nThe results of our third test are provided in Figure 3. We found that, for all δ tested, Priv’IT required\\nfewer samples than zCDP-GOF. This is unsurprising for δ very large and small, since the differential privacy\\nguarantees become very easy to satisfy, but we found it to be true for even “moderate” values of δ. This\\n1 A k-histogram is a distribution where the domain can be partitioned into k intervals such that the distribution is uniform\\nover each interval.\\n2 In particular, in Figure 3, n/200 support elements contained 1 − 10/n probability mass, but similar trends hold with\\nmodifications of these parameters.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\fIdentity Testing on a 2-Histogram\\n14000\\n\\nPriv’IT\\nzCDP-GOF\\n12000\\n\\nSample Complexity (m)\\n\\n10000\\n\\n8000\\n\\n6000\\n\\n4000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\n1000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n3000\\n4000\\nSupport Size (n)\\n\\n5000\\n\\n6000\\n\\n7000\\n\\nFigure 2: The sample complexities of Priv’IT and zCDP-GOF for identity testing on a 2-histogram\\nUniformity Testing, Revisited\\nzCDP-GOF\\nPriv’IT (δ = 1/e)\\n\\n80000\\n\\nPriv’IT (δ = 1/e2 )\\nPriv’IT (δ = 1/e4 )\\nPriv’IT (δ = 1/e8 )\\nSample Complexity (m)\\n\\n60000\\n\\nPriv’IT (δ = 1/e16 )\\n\\n40000\\n\\n20000\\n\\n0\\n0\\n\\n1000\\n\\n2000\\n\\n3000\\nSupport Size (n)\\n\\n4000\\n\\n5000\\n\\n6000\\n\\nFigure 3: The sample complexities of Priv’IT and zCDP-GOF for uniformity testing, with approximate\\ndifferential privacy\\nimplies that if an analyst is satisfied with approximate differential privacy, she might be better off using\\nPriv’IT, rather than an algorithm which guarantees zCDP.\\nWhile the main focus of our evaluation was statistical in nature, we will note that Priv’IT was more\\nefficient in runtime than our implementation of MCGOF, and more efficient in memory usage than our implementation of zCDP-GOF. The former point was observed by noting that, in the same amount of time, Priv’IT\\nwas able to reach a trial corresponding to a support size of 20000, while MCGOF was only able to reach 10000.\\nThe latter point was observed by noting that zCDP-GOF ran out of memory at a support size of 11800.

It is plausible that all of\\nthese implementations could be made more time and memory efficient, but we found our implementations\\nto be sufficient for the sake of our comparison.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Jon Ullman for helpful discussions in the early stages of this work.

      "Standard detectors aren’t (currently) fooled by physical adversarial stop signs\\n\\narXiv:1710.03337v2 [cs.CV] 26 Oct 2017\\n\\nJiajun Lu, Hussein Sibai, Evan Fabry, David Forsyth\\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana Champaign\\n{jlu23, sibai2, efabry2, daf}@illinois.edu\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nclassified) or not [20, 8, 21, 12, 2, 4]. Current procedures to\\nbuild adversarial examples for deep networks appear to subvert the feature construction implemented by the network to\\nproduce odd patterns of activation in late stage RELU’s; this\\ncan be exploited to build one form of defence [10]. There\\nis some evidence that other feature constructions admit adversarial attacks, too [12]. The success of these attacks can\\nbe seen as a warning not to use very highly non-linear feature constructions without having strong mathematical constraints on what these constructions can do; but taking that\\nposition means one cannot use methods that are largely accurate and effective.\\n\\nAn adversarial example is an example that has been adjusted to produce the wrong label when presented to a system at test time. If adversarial examples existed that could\\nfool a detector, they could be used to (for example) wreak\\nhavoc on roads populated with smart vehicles. Recently, we\\ndescribed our difficulties creating physical adversarial stop\\nsigns that fool a detector. More recently, Evtimov et al. produced a physical adversarial stop sign that fools a proxy\\nmodel of a detector. In this paper, we show that these physical adversarial stop signs do not fool two standard detectors\\n(YOLO and Faster RCNN) in standard configuration. Evtimov et al.’s construction relies on a crop of the image to the\\nstop sign; this crop is then resized and presented to a classifier. We argue that the cropping and resizing procedure\\nlargely eliminates the effects of rescaling and of view angle. Whether an adversarial attack is robust under rescaling and change of view direction remains moot. We argue\\nthat attacking a classifier is very different from attacking a\\ndetector, and that the structure of detectors – which must\\nsearch for their own bounding box, and which cannot estimate that box very accurately – likely makes it difficult to\\nmake adversarial patterns. Finally, an adversarial pattern\\non a physical object that could fool a detector would have\\nto be adversarial in the face of a wide family of parametric\\ndistortions (scale; view angle; box shift inside the detector;\\nillumination; and so on). Such a pattern would be of great\\ntheoretical and practical interest. There is currently no evidence that such patterns exist.\\n\\nIt is important to distinguish between a classifier and a\\ndetector to understand the current state of the art. A classifier accepts an image and produces a label. Classifiers\\nare scored on accuracy. A detector, like FasterRCNN [18],\\nidentifies image boxes that are “worth labelling”, and then\\ngenerates labels (which might include background) for\\neach. The final label generation step employs a classifier.\\nHowever, the statistics of how boxes span objects in a detector are complex and poorly understood. Some modern\\ndetectors like YOLO 9000 [17] predict boxes and labels\\nusing features on a fixed grid, resulting in fairly complex\\nsampling patterns in the space of boxes, and meaning that\\npixels outside a box may participate in labelling that box.\\nOne cannot have too many boxes, because too many boxes\\nmeans much redundancy; worse, it imposes heavy demands\\non the accuracy of the classifier. Too few boxes chances\\nmissing objects. Detectors are scored on a composite score,\\ntaking into account both the accuracy with which the detector labels the box and the accuracy of the placement of the\\nbox.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\nIt is usual to attack classifiers, and all the attacks of\\nwhich we are aware are attacks on classifiers. However,\\nfor many applications, classifiers are not themselves useful. Road signs are a good example. A road sign classifier\\nwould be applied to images that consist largely of road sign\\n(e.g. those of [22]). But there is little application need for\\na road-sign classifier except as a component of a road sign\\ndetector, because one doesn’t usually have to deal with images that consist largely of road sign. Instead, one deals\\n\\nAn adversarial example is an example that has been adjusted to produce the wrong label when presented to a system at test time. Adversarial examples are of interest only\\nbecause the adjustments required seem to be very small and\\nare easy to obtain [23, 7, 5]. Numerous search procedures\\ngenerate adversarial examples [14, 16, 15]. There is fair evidence that it is hard to tell whether an example is adversarial\\n(and so (a) evidence of an attack and (b) likely to be mis1\\n\\n\fwith images that contain many things, and must find and\\nlabel the road sign. It is quite natural to study road sign\\nclassifiers (e.g. [19]) because image classification remains\\ndifficult and academic studies of feature constructions are\\nimportant. But there is no particular threat posed by an attack on a road sign classifier. An attack on a road sign detector is an entirely different matter. For example, imagine\\npossessing a template that, with a can of spray paint, could\\nensure that a detector read a stop sign as a yield sign (or\\nworse!). As a result, it is important to know whether (a)\\nsuch examples could exist and (b) how robust their adversarial property is in practice.\\nPrinting adversarial images then photographing them can\\nretain their adversarial property [9, 1], which suggests adversarial examples might exist in the physical world. Adversarial examples in the physical world could cause a great\\ndeal of mischief. In earlier work, we showed that it was\\ndifficult to build physical examples that fooled a stop-sign\\ndetector [11]. In particular, if one actually takes video of\\nadversarial stop-signs out of doors, the adversarial pattern\\ndoes not appear to affect the performance of the detector by\\nmuch. We speculated that this might be because adversarial\\npatterns were disrupted by being viewed at different scales,\\nrotations, and orientations. This generated some discussion.\\nOpenAI demonstrated a search procedure that could produce an image of a cat that was misclassified when viewed\\nat multiple scales [1]. There is some blurring of the fur texture on the cat, but this would likely be imperceptible to\\nmost observers. OpenAI also demonstrated a search procedure that could produce an image of a cat that was misclassified when viewed at multiple scales and orientations [1].\\nHowever, there are significant visible artifacts on that image; few would feel that it had not obviously been tampered\\nwith.\\nRecently, Evtimov et al. have demonstrated several\\nphysical stop-signs that are misclassified [3]. Their attack\\nis demonstrated on stop-signs that are cropped from images\\nand presented to a classifier. By cropping, they have proxied the box-prediction process in a detector; however, their\\nattack is not intended as an attack on a detector (the paper\\ndoes not use the word “detector”, for example). In this paper, we show that standard off-the-shelf detectors that have\\nnot seen adversarial examples in training detect their stop\\nsigns rather well, under a variety of conditions. We explain\\n(a) why their result is puzzling; (b) why their result may\\nhave to do with specific details of their pipeline model, particularly the classifier construction and (c) why the distinction between a classifier and a detector means their work has\\nnot put the core issue – can one build physical adversarial\\nstop-signs? – to rest.\\n\\n2. Experimental Results\\nEvtimov et. al have demonstrated a construction of physical adversarial stop signs [3]. They demonstrate poster attacks (the stop sign is covered with a poster that looks like\\na faded stop sign) and sticker attacks (the attacker makes\\nstickers placed on particular locations on a stop sign), and\\nconclude that one can make physical adversarial stop signs.\\nThere are two types of tests: stationary tests, where the sign\\nis imaged from a variety of orientations and directions; and\\ndrive-by tests, where the sign is viewed from a camera based\\non a car.\\nWe obtained two standard detectors (the MS-COCO pretrained standard YOLO [17]; Faster RCNN [18], pretrained\\nversion available on github) and applied them to the images\\nand videos from their paper.

Classifiers and Detectors are Very Different\\nSystems\\nThe details of the system attacked are important in assessing the threat posed by Evtimov et al.’s stop signs. Their\\nprocess is: acquire image (or video frame); crop to sign;\\nthen classify that box. This process is seen in earlier road\\nsign literature, including [22, 19]. The attack is on the clas-\\n\\nsifier. There are two classifiers, distinguished by architecture and training details. LISA-CNN consists of three convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer ( [3],\\np5, c1), trained to classify signs into 17 classes ( [3], p4, c2),\\nusing the LISA dataset of US road signs [13]. The other is\\na publicly available implementation (from [24]) of a classifier demonstrated to work well at road signs (in [19]); this\\nis trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ([22]), with US stop signs added. Both classifiers are\\naccurate ( [3], p5, c1). Each classifier is applied to 32 × 32\\nimages ( [3], p4, c2). However, in both stationary and drive\\n\\n\fFigure 4: In relatively low resolution, YOLO detects printed poster physical adversarial stop sign and real stop sign similarly.\\n\\nFigure 5: In relatively low resolution, YOLO detects sticker physical adversarial stop sign and real stop sign similarly.\\nby tests, the image is cropped and resized ( [3], p8, c2).\\nAn attack on a road sign classifier is of no particular interest in and of itself, because no application requires classification of close cropped images of road signs. An attack\\non a road sign detector is an entirely different matter. We\\ninterpret Evtimov et al.’s pipeline as a proxy model of a\\ndetection system, where the cropping procedure spoofs the\\nprocess in a detector that produces bounding boxes. This is\\nour interpretation of the paper, but it is not an unreasonable\\ninterpretation; for example, table VII of [3] shows boxes\\n\\nplaced over small road signs in large images, which suggests authors have some form of detection process in mind.\\nWe speculate that several features of this proxy model make\\nit a relatively poor model of a modern detection system.\\nThese features also make the classifier that labels boxes relatively vulnerable to adversarial constructions.\\nThe key feature of detection systems is that they tend not\\nto get the boxes exactly right (for example, look at the boxes\\nin Figure 12), because it is extremely difficult to do. Localization of boxes is measured using the intersection over\\n\\n\fFigure 6: In relatively low resolution, Faster RCNN detects printed poster physical adversarial stop sign and real stop sign\\nsimilarly.\\n\\nFigure 7: In relatively low resolution, Faster RCNN detects sticker physical adversarial stop sign and real stop sign similarly.\\nunion score; one computes AI /AU , where AI is the area\\nof intersection between predicted and true box, and AU is\\nthe area of the union of these boxes. For example, YOLO\\nhas a mean Average Precision of 78.6% at an IOU score of\\n.5 – this means that only boxes with IOU with respect to\\nground truth of .5 or greater are counted as a true detection. Even with very strong modern detectors, scores fall\\nfast with increasing IOU threshold. How detection systems\\npredict boxes depends somewhat on the architecture. Faster\\n\\nRCNN predicts interesting boxes, then classifies them [18].\\nYOLO uses a grid of cells, where each cell uses features\\ncomputed from much of the image to predict boxes and labels near that cell, with confidence information [17]. One\\nshould think of this architecture as an efficient way of predicting interesting boxes, then classifying them. All this\\nmeans that, in modern detector systems, boxes are not centered cleanly on objects. We are not aware of any literature\\non the statistics of box locations with respect to a root coor-\\n\\n\fFigure 8: In higher resolution video, YOLO detects printed poster physical adversarial stop sign well.

However, these details matter. We believe\\ntheir results are most easily explained by assuming the sign\\nwas cropped reasonably accurately to its bounding box, then\\nresized (Table VII of [3], shown for the reader’s convenience here as Figure 12). If the sign is cropped reasonably accurately to its bounding box, then resized, the visual\\neffects of slant and scale are largely removed. In particular, isotropic resizing removes effects of scale other than\\nloss of spatial precision in the sampling grid This means the\\nclaim that the adversarial construction is invariant to slant\\nand scale is moot. Close cropping is not a feature of modern\\ndetection systems, and would make the proxy model poor.\\nLow resolution boxes: Almost every pixel in an accurately cropped box will testify to the presence of a stop sign.\\nThus, very low resolution boxes may mean that fewer pixels\\nneed to be modified to confuse the underlying classifier. In\\ncontrast to the 32x32 boxes of [3], YOLO uses a 7x7 grid\\non a 448x448 dimension image; each grid cell predicts pre-\\n\\ndict bounding box extents and labels. This means that each\\nprediction in YOLO observes at least 64x64 pixels. The relatively low resolution of the classifier used makes the proxy\\nmodel poor.\\nCropping and variance: Detection systems like YOLO\\nor Faster RCNN cannot currently produce accurate bounding boxes. Producing very accurate boxes requires searching a larger space of boxes, and so creates problems with\\nfalse positives. While there are post-processing methods to\\nimprove boxes [6], this tension is fundamental (for example, see figure 2 and 3). In turn, this means that the classification procedure within the detector must cope with a\\nrange of shifts between box and object. We speculate that,\\nin a detection system, this could serve to disrupt adversarial patterns, because the pattern might be presented to the\\nclassification process inside the detector in a variety of locations relative to the bounding box. In other words, the\\nadversarial property of the pattern would need to be robust\\nto shifts and rescales within the box. At the very least, this\\neffect means that one cannot draw conclusions from the experiments of [3].\\nCropping and context: The relatively high variance of\\nbounding boxes around objects in detector systems has an-\\n\\n\fFigure 10: In higher resolution video, Faster RCNN detects printed poster physical adversarial stop sign very well.\\n\\nFigure 11: In higher resolution video, Faster RCNN detects sticker physical adversarial stop sign very well.\\nother effect. The detector system sees object context information that may have been hidden in the proxy model. For\\nexample, cells in YOLO do not distinguish between pixels\\ncovered by a box and others when deciding (a) where the\\nbox is and (b) what is in it. While the value of this information remains moot, its absence means the proxy model is a\\npoor model.\\n\\n4. Discussion\\nWe do not claim that detectors are necessarily immune\\nto physical adversarial examples. Instead, we claim that\\nthere is no evidence as of writing that a physical adversarial\\nexample can be constructed that fools a detector. In earlier\\nwork, we said we had not produced such examples. The\\nmain point of this paper is to point out that others have not,\\ntoo; and that fooling a detector is a very different business\\nfrom fooling a classifier.\\nThere is a tension between the test-time accuracy of a\\nclassifier, and the ability to construct adversarial examples\\nthat are “like” and “close to” real images but are misclassified. In particular, if there are lots of such things, why is\\nthe classifier accurate on test? How does the test procedure\\n“know” not to produce adversarial examples? The usual,\\nand natural, explanation is that the measure of the space\\nof adversarial examples A under the distribution of images\\n\\nP (I) is “small”. Notice that A is interesting only if P (A)\\nis small and for most u ∈ A, P (u) is “big” (i.e. there is not\\nmuch point in an adversarial example that doesn’t look like\\nan image) and there there is at least some of A “far” from\\ntrue classifier boundaries (i.e. there is not much point in replacing a stop sign with a yield sign, then complaining it is\\nmislabelled). This means that A must have small volume,\\ntoo. If A has small volume, but it is easy for an optimization\\nprocess to find an adversarial example close to any particular example, then there must also be a piece of A quite close\\nto most examples (one can think of “bubbles” or “tubes” of\\nbad labels threading through the space of images). In this\\nview, Evtimov et al.’s paper presents an important puzzle.\\nIf one can construct an adversarial pattern that remains adversarial for a three dimensional range of views (two angles\\nand a scale), this implies that close to any particular pattern\\nthere is a three parameter “sheet” inside A – but how does\\nthe network know to organize its errors into a form that is\\nconsistent with nuisance viewing parameters?\\nOne answer is that it is trained to do so because it is\\ntrained on different views of objects, meaning that A has internal structure learned from training examples. While this\\ncan’t be disproved, it certainly hasn’t been proved. This\\nanswer would imply that, in some way, the architecture of\\nthe network can generalize across viewing parameters better\\n\\n\fFigure 12: Table VII of [3], reproduced for the reader’s convenience. Note the close crops of stop signs, shown as yellow\\nboxes. The whole image could not be passed to a stop sign classifier; therefore, some form of box must be produced. In\\nthat paper, the box is produced by cropping and resizing the crop to a standard size. In the text, we argue that this cropping\\nsuppresses the effects of scale and slant. However, it is a poor model of the boxes produced by modern detectors, because it\\nis placed accurately round the sign.\\nthan it generalizes across labels (after all, the existence of\\nan adversarial example is a failure to generalize labels correctly). Believing this requires fairly compelling evidence.\\nOckham’s razor suggests another answer: Evtimov et al.,\\nby cropping closely to the stop sign, removed most of the\\neffect of slant and scale, and so the issue does not arise.\\nWhether physical adversarial examples exist that fool a\\ndetector is a question of the first importance. Here are quite\\ngood reasons they might not. An adversarial pattern on a\\nphysical object that could fool a detector would have to be\\nadversarial in the face of a wide family of parametric distortions (scale; view angle; box shift inside the detector;\\nillumination; and so on). While it is quite possible that the\\nbox created by the detector reduces the effects of view angle\\nand scaling, at least for plane objects, the box shift is an important effect. There is no evidence that adversarial patterns\\nexist that can fool a detector. Finding such patterns (or disproving their existence) is an important technical challenge.\\nMore likely to exist, but significantly less of a nuisance, is\\na pattern that, viewed under the right circumstances (and so\\njust occasionally) would fool a detector.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are particularly grateful to Ivan Evtimov, Kevin\\nEykholt, Earlence Fernandes, Tadayoshi Kohno, Bo Li,\\nAtul Prakash, Amir Rahmati, and Dawn Song, the authors\\nof [3], who have generously shared data and have made\\ncomments on this manuscript which lead to improvements.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] A.

      "SE3-Pose-Nets: Structured Deep Dynamics Models for Visuomotor Planning\\nand Control\\n\\narXiv:1710.00489v1 [cs.RO] 2 Oct 2017\\n\\nArunkumar Byravan, Felix Leeb, Franziska Meier and Dieter Fox\\nDepartment of Computer Science & Engineering\\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle\\n\\nAbstract— In this work, we present an approach to deep\\nvisuomotor control using structured deep dynamics models.\\nOur deep dynamics model, a variant of SE3-Nets, learns a\\nlow-dimensional pose embedding for visuomotor control via an\\nencoder-decoder structure. Unlike prior work, our dynamics\\nmodel is structured: given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts and predict their poseembedding along with their motion modeled as a change in\\nthe pose space due to the applied actions. We train our model\\nusing a pair of point clouds separated by an action and show\\nthat given supervision only in the form of point-wise data\\nassociations between the frames our network is able to learn\\na meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent\\nposes. We further show that our model can be used for closedloop control directly in the learned low-dimensional pose space,\\nwhere the actions are computed by minimizing error in the\\npose space using gradient-based methods, similar to traditional\\nmodel-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter\\nrobot from raw depth data in simulation and in the real world\\nand compare against two baseline deep networks. Our method\\nruns in real-time, achieves good prediction of scene dynamics\\nand outperforms the baseline methods on multiple control\\nruns.

I NTRODUCTION\\nImagine we are receiving observations of a scene from\\na camera and we would like to control our robot to reach\\na target scene. Traditional approaches to visual servoing\\n[1] decompose this problem into two parts: data-associating\\nthe current scene to the target (usually through the use of\\nfeatures) and modeling the effect of applied actions to changes\\nto the scene, combining these in a tight loop to servo to\\nthe target. Recent work on deep learning has looked at\\nlearning similar predictive models directly in the space of\\nobservations, relating changes in pixels or 3D points directly\\nto the applied actions [2]–[4]. Given a target scene, we can\\nuse this predictive model to generate suitable controls to\\nvisually servo to the target using model-predictive control [5].\\nUnfortunately, for this pipeline to work, we need an external\\nsystem (such as [6], [7]) capable of providing long range\\ndata associations to measure progress.\\nAs we showed in prior work [4], instead of reasoning about\\nraw pixels, we can predict scene dynamics by decomposing\\nthe scene into objects and predicting object dynamics instead.\\nWhile this significantly improves prediction results, it still\\ndoes not provide a clear solution to the data-association\\nproblem that we encounter during control - we still lack\\nthe capability to explicitly associate objects/parts across\\n\\nFig. 1: An example scenario showing the initial (left) and\\ntarget point cloud (right). SE3-P OSE -N ETS can be used to\\ncontrol the robot to reach the target state based only on raw\\ndepth data. Depth images colorized for display purposes only.\\nscenes. We observe three key points: 1) We can dataassociate across scenes by learning to predict the poses\\nof detected objects/parts in the scene (the pose implicitly\\nprovides tracking), 2) We can model the dynamics of an\\nobject directly in the predicted low-dimensional pose space,\\nand 3) We can predict scene dynamics by combining the\\ndynamics predictions of each detected part.\\nWe combine these ideas in this work to propose SE3-P OSE N ETS, a deep network architecture for efficient visuomotor\\ncontrol that jointly learns to data-associate across long term\\nsequences. We make the following contributions:\\n• We show how it is possible to learn predictive models\\nthat detect parts of the scene and jointly learn a consistent\\npose space for these parts with minimal supervision.\\n• We demonstrate how a deep predictive model can be\\nused for reactive visuo-motor control using simple\\ngradient backpropagation and a more sophisticated\\nGauss-Newton optimization, reminiscent of approaches\\nin inverse kinematics [8].\\n• We present results on real-time reactive control of a\\nBaxter arm using raw depth images and velocity control,\\nboth in simulation and on real data.\\nFig 1 shows an example scenario where our proposed method\\ncan be applied to control the robot to reach the target state\\n(right) from the initial state (left).\\nII. R ELATED WORK\\nModeling scenes and dynamics: Our work builds on\\ntop of prior work on learning structured models of scene\\ndynamics [4]. Unlike SE3-N ETS we now explicitly model\\ndata associations through a low-dimensional pose embedding\\nthat we train to be consistent across long sequences. Similar to\\nBoots et al. [2], our model learns to predict point clouds based\\n\\n\fon applied actions, but through a more structured intermediate\\nrepresentation that reasons about objects and their motions.\\nUnlike Finn et al. [3], we operate on depth data and reason\\nabout motion in 3D using masks and SE(3) transforms while\\ntraining our networks in a supervised fashion given point-wise\\ndata associations across pairs of frames.\\nVisuomotor control: Recently, there has been a lot of\\nwork on visuomotor control, primarily through the use of deep\\nnetworks [5], [9]–[13]. These methods either directly regress\\nto controls from visual data [10], [11], generate controls\\nby planning on learned forward dynamics models [5], [9],\\nthrough inverse dynamics models [12] or by reinforcement\\nlearning [13]. Similar to some of these methods, we generates\\ncontrols by planning with a learned dynamics model, albeit\\nin a learned low-dimensional latent space. Specifically, work\\nby Finn et al. [5] is closely related, but differs in two main\\nways: unlike their approach which controls in the observation\\nspace through sampled actions (at ≈ 5Hz), our controller runs\\ngradient based optimization on a learned low-dimensional\\npose embedding in real-time (> 30 Hz). Also, their approach\\nrequires an external tracker to measure progress while we\\nexplicitly learn to data associate across large motions.\\nOur work borrows several ideas from prior work by Watter\\net al. [9] which learns a latent low-dimensional embedding\\nfor fast reactive control from pairs of images related by an\\naction. Unlike their work though, we use a structured latent\\nrepresentation (object poses), predict object masks and use\\na physically grounded 3D loss that only models change in\\nobservations as opposed to a restrictive image reconstruction\\nloss. Last, our losses are physically motivated similar to those\\nproposed for training position-velocity encoders [13], but our\\nlearned pose embedding is significantly more structured and\\nwe train our networks end-to-end directly for control.\\nData association: Related work in the computer vision\\nliterature has looked at tackling the data association problem,\\nprimarily by matching visual descriptors, either hand-tuned\\n[14], or more recently, learned using deep networks [15],\\n[16]. In prior work, Schmidt et al. [15] learn robust visual\\ndescriptors for long-range associations using correspondences\\nover short training sequences. Unlike this work, we only use\\ncorrespondences between pairs of frames to learn a consistent\\npose space that lets us data associate across long sequences.\\nVisual servoing: Finally, there have been multiple\\napproaches to visual servoing over the years [1], [17], [18],\\nincluding some newer methods that use deep learned features\\nand reinforcement learning [19]. While these methods depend\\non an external system for data association or on pre-specified\\nfeatures, our system is trained end-to-end and can control\\ndirectly from raw depth data.\\nIII. SE3-P OSE -N ETS\\nOur deep dynamics model SE3-P OSE -N ETS decomposes\\nthe problem of modeling scene dynamics into three subproblems: a) modeling scene structure by identifying parts of\\nthe scene that move distinctly and by encoding their latent\\nstate as a 6D pose, b) modeling the dynamics of individual\\nparts under the effect of the applied actions as a change in the\\n\\nlatent pose space (parameterized as an SE(3) transform), and\\nfinally c) combining these local pose changes to model the\\ndynamics of the entire scene. Each sub-problem is modeled\\nby a separate component of the SE3-P OSE -N ET:\\n• Modeling scene structure: An encoder (henc ) that\\ndecomposes the input point cloud (x1 ) into a set of\\nK rigid parts, predicting per part a 6D pose (pk ,\\nk = 1 . . . K) and a dense segmentation mask (mk ) that\\nhighlights points belonging to that part\\n• Modeling part dynamics: A pose transition network\\n(htrans ) that models dynamics in the pose space, taking\\nin the current poses (pt ) and action (ut ) to predict the\\nchange in poses (∆pt )\\n• Predicting scene dynamics: A transform layer (htf m )\\nthat predicts the next point cloud (x̂t+1 ) given the current\\npoint cloud (xt ), predicted object masks (mt ) and the\\npredicted pose deltas (∆pt ) by explicitly applying 3D\\nrigid body SE(3) transforms on the input point cloud.\\nFig. 2 shows the network architecture of the SE3-P OSE -N ET.\\nNext, we present the details of the three sub-components and\\noutline a training procedure for training the SE3-P OSE -N ET\\nend-to-end with minimal supervision.\\nA. Modeling scene structure\\nGiven a 3D point cloud x from a depth sensor (represented\\nas a 3-channel image, 3 x H x W), the encoder (blue block\\nin Fig. 2) segments the scene into distinctly moving parts\\n(m) and predicts a 6D pose per segmented part (p).\\n(p, m) = henc (x)\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThe encoder has three parts, the first is a convolutional network that generates a latent representation of the input point\\ncloud (x). This network has five convolutional layers, each\\nfollowed by a max pooling layer. The latent representation\\nis further used as input for the mask and pose predictions.\\nObject masks: We use a de-convolutional network to\\npredict a dense pixel-wise segmentation of the scene into\\nit’s constituent parts (m). Similar to prior work [4], we use\\na fully-convolutional architecture with five de-convolutional\\nlayers and a skip-add architecture to improve the sharpness\\nof the predicted segmentation. The masks predicted by this\\nnetwork are at full resolution with K channels (K x H x W),\\nwhere K is a pre-specified hyper-parameter that is greater\\nthan or equal to the number of moving parts in the scene\\n(including background). The predicted segmentation mask\\nlearns to attend to parts of the scene that move together,\\nrepresenting areas of the scene that can move independently\\nas different parts. As in prior work [4], we formalize mask\\nprediction as a soft-classification problem where the network\\noutputs a k-length probability distribution which we sharpen\\nto push towards a binary segmentation mask.\\nObject poses: Given the encoded latent representation,\\nwe use a three layer fully-connected network to predict the\\n6D pose pk of each of the K segmented parts.

Bottom Left: Graph showing the procedure for training the SE3-P OSE -N ET along with two loss functions: a 3D loss on the\\npredicted point cloud (Lx ) and a pose consistency loss (Lp ) relating the \"next\" poses predicted by the transform network (p̂t+1 ) and\\nthe encoder (pt+1 ). Bottom Right: Control using the SE3-P OSE -N ET. Given a target point cloud (xT ) encoded as poses (pT ) through\\nthe learned encoder, we use the learned transition model (htrans ) to plan a sequence of actions u0 , u1 , ..., uT by minimizing error (E)\\ndirectly in the pose space from an initial point cloud p0 .\\n\\norientation (R ∈ SO(3)), represented as a 3-parameter axisangle vector. As we show later, our pose network learns to\\npredict consistent poses which can be used to data-associate\\nobservations over long sequences of motions.\\nAt a high level, the encoder implicitly learns the structure\\nof observed scenes by persistently identifying parts and\\npredicting a consistent pose for each part across multiple\\nscenes.\\nB. Modeling part dynamics\\nOnce we have identified the constituent parts of the\\nscene and their poses, we can reason about the effect of\\napplied actions on these parts. We model this notion of \"part\\ndynamics\" through a fully-connected pose transition network\\nthat takes the predicted poses from the encoder (p) and\\napplied actions (u) as input to predict the change in pose\\n(∆p) for all K segmented parts:\\n∆p = htrans (p, u)\\n(2)\\nwhere ∆p = [R, T] is represented as an SE(3) transform\\nper part, with a rotation Rk ∈ SO(3) (parameterized as an\\naxis-angle transform) and a translation vector Tk ∈ R3 . The\\ntransition network first applies two fully connected layers to\\nboth inputs, concatenates their outputs followed by two final\\nfully-connected layers to predict the pose-deltas. As we show\\n\\nlater in Sec. IV we rely on good predictions of pose-deltas\\nthrough the pose-transition network for efficient control.\\nC. Predicting scene dynamics\\nFinally, given the predicted scene segmentation (mt ) and\\nthe change in poses (∆pt ), we can model the dynamics of\\nthe input scene (xt ) under the effect of the applied action\\n(ut ). We do this through the Transform layer (htf m ) which\\napplies the predicted rigid rotations (Rt ) and translations\\n(Tt ) to the input point cloud, weighted by the predicted mask\\nprobabilities (mt ). We predict the transformed point cloud\\n(x̂t+1 ) as:\\nK\\n\u0010\\n\u0011\\nX\\nmkj\\nx̂jt+1 =\\nRtk xjt + Ttk\\n(3)\\nt\\nk=1\\n\\nwhere x̂jt+1 is the 3D output point corresponding to input point\\nxjt . In effect, we apply the kth rotation and translation (∆pk =\\n[Rk , T k ]) to all points xj that belong to the corresponding\\nobject as indicated by the kth mask channel mk (assuming\\nthat the mask is binary after weight sharpening) to predict the\\ntransformed points x̂j belonging to that object. Repeating this\\nfor all objects gives us the transformed output point cloud\\n(x̂). Note that this part has no trainable parameters. For more\\ndetails, please refer to prior work [4].\\n\\n\fD. Training\\nWe now outline a procedure to train the SE3-P OSE -N ET\\nend-to-end, using supervision in the form of point-wise data\\nassociations across a pair of point clouds (xt , xt+1 ), related\\nby an action (ut ) i.e. for each input point (xit ), we know\\nit’s corresponding point in the next frame if it is visible\\n(xit+1 ). No other supervision is given for learning the masks,\\nposes, and the change in poses. Fig. 2 (bottom-left) shows a\\nschematic of this procedure. Given two point clouds xt , xt+1 ,\\nwe use the encoder to predict the corresponding masks and\\nposes:\\npt , mt = henc (xt )\\npt+1 , mt+1 = henc (xt+1 )\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nNext, the predicted pose (pt ) and control (ut ) at t are used\\nas input to the pose transition network to predict the change\\nin pose from t to t + 1:\\n∆pt = htrans (pt , ut )\\n(5)\\nFinally, we use the transform layer (3) to predict the next\\npoint cloud:\\nx̂t+1 = htf m (xt , mt , ∆pt )\\n(6)\\nThe predicted mask (mt+1 ) at time t + 1 is discarded. We\\nuse two losses to train the entire pipeline end to end:\\n• A 3D loss (Lx ) that penalizes the error between the\\npredicted point cloud (x̂t+1 ) and the data associated\\ntarget point cloud (x̃t+1 ). We use a normalized version\\nof the mean-squared error (MSE) that measures the\\nnegative log-likelihood under a Gaussian centered around\\nthe target with a standard deviation dependent on the\\ntarget magnitude:\\nHW\\n1 X (x̂it+1 − x̃it+1 )2\\n(7)\\nLx =\\nN\\nαf˜i + β\\ni=1\\n\\n•\\n\\nwhere (f˜i = x̃it+1 − xit ) denotes the ground truth motion\\nfor point i relative to the input point cloud xt , HW is\\nthe number of points in the point cloud, N is the number\\nof points that actually move between t and t + 1 and α\\n& β are hyper-parameters (α = 0.5, β = 1e − 3 in all\\nour experiments). This loss is aimed to tackle two main\\nissues with a standard MSE loss: a) By normalizing\\nthe loss by a separate scalar per dimension (f˜i ) that\\ndepends on the target magnitude we make the loss scale\\ninvariant allowing us to treat equally parts that move less\\n(such as the end-effector when only the wrist rotates)\\nas those that have large motion (eg. the elbow), and b)\\nBy dividing the total error by the number of points (N )\\nthat move in the scene, we treat scenes where very few\\npoints move equally as those where large parts move.\\nA pose consistency loss (Lp ) that encourages consistency\\nbetween the poses predicted by the encoder (pt , pt+1 )\\nand the change in pose predicted by the pose transition\\nnetwork (∆pt ):\\np̂t+1 = pt ⊕ ∆pt\\nLp =\\n\\n1\\nI\\n\\nI\\nX\\n\\n(p̂it+1 − pit+1 )2\\n\\ni=1\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nwhere ⊕ refers to composition in SE(3) pose space,\\np̂t+1 is the expected pose at t + 1 from composing the\\ncurrent pose (pt ) and the predicted pose change from the\\ntransition model (∆pt ) and I is the cardinality of pt . In\\nessence, this loss constrains the encoder to predict poses\\nthat are consistent with the pose-deltas predicted by the\\ntransition model. This loss encourages global consistency\\nin the pose space by enforcing local consistency over\\npairs of frames and is crucial for learning a pose space\\nthat is consistent across long term motions.\\nThe total loss for training (L) is a sum of the two losses:\\nL = Lx + γLp , where γ controls the relative strengths of the\\ntwo losses. We set γ = 10 in all our experiments. A key point\\nto note is that we do not provide any explicit supervision\\nto learn the pose space. While the consistency loss ensures\\nthat the poses are more or less globally consistent, it does\\nnot anchor them to a specific 3D position or orientation. As\\nsuch, the poses learned by the network need not correspond\\ndirectly to the canonical 6D pose of the parts - the predicted\\npart position y k does not need to correspond to its center\\nand the orientation need not be aligned to the part’s principal\\naxes. Providing more constraints to regularize and physically\\nground the pose space is an interesting area for future work.\\nIV. C LOSED -L OOP V ISUOMOTOR C ONTROL USING\\nSE3-P OSE -N ETS\\nWe now show how an SE3-P OSE -N ET can be used for\\nclosed-loop visuomotor control to reach a target specified as a\\ntarget depth image, essentially performing visual servoing [1].\\nA crucial component of every visual servoing system is to\\nperform data association between the current image and the\\ntarget image, which can then be used to generate controls\\nthat reduce the corresponding offsets. SE3-P OSE -N ETS solve\\nthis problem by making use of the learned, low-dimensional\\nlatent pose space. By enforcing frame-to-frame consistency\\nin the pose space through the consistency loss (Eqn. 8), the\\npose space becomes consistent, that is, our encoder network\\nlearns to data-associate observations to unique poses which\\nare consistent under the effect of actions. Importantly, these\\ndata associations are generated at the mask, or object level,\\nresulting in an ability akin to object detection in computer\\nvision. Unlike prior work [4], [20] which is restricted to\\noperate in the observation space of 3D points and requires\\ndata associations between current and target points to be\\nprovided externally, we can now directly minimize error\\nbetween the poses p0 and pT automatically extracted from\\nthe initial and the target depth image to recover the sequence\\nof actions that takes the robot from p0 to pt . Additionally,\\nunlike prior work [20], we do not need an external tracking\\nsystem to measure progress toward the goal as our learned\\nencoder implicitly tracks in the pose space.\\nA. Reactive control\\nAlgorithm 1 presents a simple algorithm for reactive control\\nusing SE3-P OSE -N ETS that efficiently computes a closedloop sequence of controls that takes the robot from any initial\\nstate x0 to the specified target xT (the corresponding network\\n\\n\fAlgorithm 1 Reactive visuomotor control\\nGiven: Target point cloud (xT )\\nGiven: Pre-trained encoder (henc ) and transition model\\n(htrans )\\nGiven: Maximum control magnitude: umax\\nCompute target pose: pT = henc (xT )\\nwhile not converged do\\nReceive current observation (xt )\\nPredict current pose: pt = henc (xt )\\nInitialize control to all zeros: ut = 0\\nPredict change in pose: ∆pt = htrans (pt , ut )\\nPredict next pose: p̂t+1 = ptP\\n⊕ ∆pt\\nI\\nCompute pose error: E = I1 i=1 (p̂it+1 − piT )2\\ndE\\nCompute gradient of error w.r.t. control: g =\\ndUt\\ng\\nCompute control: ut = −umax ∗\\n||g||\\nExecute control ut on the robot\\nstructure is given in the lower right panel of Fig. 2). Given a\\ntarget point cloud, xT , the algorithm uses the learned encoder\\nto predict the poses of the constituent parts pT = henc (xT ).\\nThis becomes the target to the controller.\\nAt every time step, the algorithm computes the pose\\nembedding pt of the current observation xt . We would\\nlike to find controls that move these poses closer to the\\ntarget poses. To do this, the algorithm makes a prediction\\nthrough the learned pose transition model using the current\\nposes (pt ) and an initial guess for the controls (here we\\nuse ut = 0), resulting in a predicted change in poses (∆pt )\\nand the corresponding predicted next pose (p̂t+1 ) 2 . To move\\nthese poses towards the targets, we formulate an error function\\nE based on the mean-squared error between these predicted\\nposes and the target poses. The algorithm then computes the\\ngradient of this error with respect to the control inputs, which\\nit uses to generate the next controls. We propose two ways\\nof computing the gradient:\\n•\\n\\n•\\n\\nBackpropagation: A simple approach to compute this\\ngradient update is to backpropagate the gradients of the\\npose error E through the pose transition model. Unlike\\nbackpropagation during training, where we compute\\ngradients w.r.t. the network weights, here we fix the\\nweights and compute gradients over the input controls.\\nThe resulting control scheme is analogous to the Jacobian\\nTranspose method from inverse kinematics [8], where\\nbackprop provides the gradient of the transition model.\\nGauss-Newton: A better approach is to compute the\\nGauss-Newton update:\\ng = (J T J + λI)−1 J T ∗ gP\\n(9)\\nwhere J is the Jacobian of the transition model, and gP\\nis the gradient of the pose error (E). However, instead\\nof computing g via backpropagation, we condition the\\npose error gradient (gP ) based on the Jacobian’s pseudoinverse, where λ controls the strength of the conditioning\\n\\n2 Even when using a zero control initialization, this forward pass through\\nthe network is necessary to get the correct gradients for the backward pass.\\n\\n(set to 1e-4 in all our experiments). In practice, this\\nleads to significantly faster convergence with little to\\nno additional overhead in computation compared to\\nthe backpropagation method as the Jacobian can be\\ncomputed efficiently through finite differencing. We\\ndo this by running a single forward propagation with\\nperturbed control inputs (perturbation set to 1e-3) stacked\\nalong the batch dimension to take advantage of GPU\\nparallelism. Eqn. 9 is also analogous to the Damped\\nLeast Squares technique from inverse kinematics [8].\\nFinally, the algorithm computes the unit-vector in the direction\\nof the computed update and scales this by a pre-specified\\ncontrol magnitude umax (1 radian in all our experiments)\\nto get the next control ut . We execute this control on the\\nrobot and repeat in a closed-loop until convergence measured\\neither by reaching a small error in the pose space (E < \u000f)\\nor a maximum number of iterations, whichever comes first.\\nV. E VALUATION\\nWe first evaluate SE3-P OSE -N ETS on predicting the\\ndynamics of a scene where a Baxter robot moves its right arm\\nin front of the depth camera, both in simulation and in the\\nreal world. We also present results on control performance\\nwhere the task is to control the joints of the Baxter’s right\\narm to reach a specified target observation.\\nA. Task and Data collection\\nWe first provide details on the task setting in simulation.\\nOur simulator uses OpenGL to render depth images from a\\ncamera pointed towards the robot (see Fig. 1) and is kinematic\\nwith little to no dynamics in the motion and no depth noise.\\nWe use this as a test bed to parse the effectiveness of the\\nproposed algorithm and compare it to various baselines. We\\ncollected around 8 hours of training data in the simulator\\nwhere the robot moves all joints on it’s right arm. Around half\\nof the examples are whole arm motions where the robot plans\\na trajectory to reach a target end-effector position sampled\\nrandomly in the workspace in front of the robot. The rest of\\nthe motions are made of perturbations of individual joints on\\nthe robot from various initial configurations sampled to be\\nwithin the viewpoint of the camera. These additional motions\\nhelp in de-correlating the kinematic chain dependencies\\nduring training, improving performance especially on joints\\nlower down the kinematic chain. Overall, this dataset has\\naround 800,000 training images collected from a single fixed\\nviewpoint. Similar to the simulated setting, we collect data\\nfrom the real robot where the Baxter moves its right arm in\\nfront of an ASUS Xtion Pro camera placed around 2.5 meters\\nfrom the robot. Data associations, ground truth masks, and\\nground truth flows are determined via the DART tracker [6] on\\nthe real data. We collected around 4.5 hours of training data on\\nthe real robot, with a 2:1 mix of whole arm motions and single\\njoint motions. As before, the motions were generated through\\na planner that tries to get the end-effector to randomly sampled\\ntargets in the workspace. Unlike the simulated data, the depth\\ndata in the real world is quite noisy and there are significant\\n\\n\fFig. 3: Masks generated by different networks on simulated (top) and real data (bottom).

Baselines\\nWe compare the performance of our algorithm against five\\ndifferent baselines:\\n• SE3-P OSE -N ETS + Joint Angles:\\nOur proposed\\nnetwork with the joint angles of the robot given as\\nan additional input to the encoder. We use this network\\nas a strong baseline that uses significant additional\\ninformation to inform the pose prediction.\\n• SE3-N ETS : Prior work from [4] where the network\\ndirectly predicts masks and change in poses given input\\npoint clouds and control. There is no explicit pose space\\nin this network, so we do control in the full point cloud\\nobservation space for this network.\\n• SE3-N ETS + Joint Angles: SE3-N ETS that additionally take in joint angles as inputs.\\n• Flow Net: Baseline flow model from prior work [4].\\nThis network directly regresses to a per-point 3D flow\\nwithout any explicit SE(3) transforms or masks.\\n• Flow Net + Joint Angles: Baseline flow network that\\nadditionally takes in joint angles as input.\\nAll baseline networks are trained on the same data as the\\nSE3-P OSE -N ETS using the 3D normalized loss (Lx ).\\n\\nflow MSE (cm) across all baselines on both simulated and real\\ndata. SE3-N ETS achieve the best results on both the simulated\\nand real datasets while the baseline flow network performs\\nslightly worse. Unsurprisingly, networks that have access to\\nthe joint angles do better than those which do not, as they have\\nstrictly more information that is highly correlated with the\\nsensor data. To initial surprise, the SE3-P OSE -N ETS have the\\nlargest prediction errors among all baseline models. However,\\nthis makes sense given the following considerations: a) SE3P OSE -N ETS are trained to explicitly embed the observations\\nin a pose space from which they predict the scene dynamics,\\nrather than using the input point cloud directly. While this\\nprovides more structure within the network and is necessary\\nfor the control task, it also restricts the prediction to go\\nthrough an information bottleneck which generally makes\\nthe training problem harder. b) SE3-P OSE -N ETS additionally\\nhave to optimize for the consistency loss, which enforces\\nconstraints that are different from those of the prediction\\nproblem evaluated in this experiment.\\nFig. 3 visualizes the masks predicted by SE3-P OSE -N ETS\\nand the baseline SE3-N ET on an example each from the\\nsimulated and real data along with the ground truth masks.\\nEven without any supervision, SE3-P OSE -N ETS and SE3N ETS learn a detailed segmentation of the arm into multiple\\nsalient parts, most of which are consistent with ground truth\\nsegments on both the simulated and real data.\\n\\nC. Training details\\nWe implemented our networks in PyTorch using the Adam\\noptimizer for training with a learning rate of 1e-4. All our\\nnetworks used Batch Normalization [21] and the PReLU nonlinearity [22]. We set the maximum number of moving objects\\nK = 8 for all our experiments (7 joints + background). We\\ntrain each network for 100,000 iterations in simulation and\\n75,000 iterations on the real data, and use the network that\\nachieves the least validation loss across all training iterations\\nfor all our results.\\nD. Results on modeling scene dynamics\\nFirst, we present results on the prediction task used for\\ntraining all the networks. Table I shows the average per-point\\n\\nE. Control performance\\nNext, we test the performance of the different networks\\non controlling the Baxter’s right arm to reach a target\\nconfiguration, specified as a point cloud xT . We test both\\nthe control algorithms presented in Sec. IV using our SE3P OSE -N ET model and the baseline models by comparing\\ntheir performance on a set of 11 distinct servoing tasks (each\\nwith an average initial error of ~30 degrees per joint). We\\nfirst detail a few specifics followed by an analysis of the\\nresults.\\nControl with baseline models: While SE3-P OSE -N ETS\\nlearn a pose space that can be used for long-term data\\nassociations and control, the baseline models operate directly\\n\\n\fFig. 4: Convergence of joint angle error in simulated Baxter control tasks. (left): without joint angles, (middle) without joint\\nangles and detected failure case removed (for all methods), (right) with joint angles. SE3-P OSE -N ETS perform as well or\\nbetter than baseline methods even though baseline models have additional information in the form of ground truth-associations.\\n\\nFig. 5: Convergence of joint angle error on real Baxter control\\ntasks (left) without joint angles (right) with joint angles\\n(averaged across joint 0,1,2,3).\\nin the space of observations and thus require external data\\nassociations in the observation space to be able to do any\\ncontrol at all. For the simulation experiments, we provide\\nthese baseline algorithms with ground-truth associations and\\nuse the procedure outlined in Alg. 1 using the MSE between\\nthe predicted point cloud x̂t+1 and the target xT as the error\\nto be minimized for generating controls. It is important to\\nkeep in mind that the baseline models have an advantage over\\nSE3-P OSE -N ETS for the control task as they get strictly more\\ninformation in the form of ground-truth data associations.\\nMetric and Task specification: We use the mean absolute\\nerror in the joint angles as the metric for measuring control\\nperformance. We run all models to convergence (based on\\nthe pose error for SE3-P OSE -N ETS and 3D point/flow error\\nfor the baseline models) or for a maximum of 200 iterations.\\nAdditionally, for SE3-P OSE -N ETS we terminate if the pose\\nerror increases for 10 consecutive iterations. We integrate\\njoint velocities forward to generate position commands for\\nthe robot both in simulation and the real world.\\nSimulation results: Fig. 4 plots the error in joint angles\\nas a function of the number of control iterations. The plots on\\nthe left and middle show results on networks that use only raw\\ndepth as input - we control the first six joints of the robot using\\nthese networks. The right figure shows results for networks\\nthat additionally use joint angles as input - we control all\\n7 joints of the robot with these networks. In general, SE3P OSE -N ETS achieve excellent performance compared to the\\nbaseline models, converging quickly to an almost zero error\\neven in the absence any external data associations. The\\nflow model performs comparably to the SE3-P OSE -N ETS\\nwhile SE3-N ETS converge far slower. We highlight a few key\\nresults: 1) For all methods, Gauss-Newton based optimization\\n(GN) leads to faster convergence than Backprop. This is to\\nbe expected as Gauss-Newton conditions the gradient based\\n\\non pseudo-second order information. 2) Baseline models\\nperform worse given joint angles than without. This is due\\nto an issue of credit assignment during gradient computation\\n- the networks learn erroneous causations (when there are\\nonly correlations) between the input joint angles and the\\npredicted flows which diminishes the control’s contribution to\\nthe prediction problem and subsequently affects the gradient.\\n3) All models struggle to model the motion of the final wrist\\njoint due to increasing correlations along the kinematic chain\\nthat result in a small contribution of the joint’s own motion\\nto the full movement of the wrist. SE3-P OSE -N ETS can\\novercome this problem given input joint angles (Fig. 4, right)\\nwhich provides encouraging proof that adding in the joint state\\nsupplements information that is hard to parse directly from\\nthe visual state. 4) SE3-N ETS converge slowly due to a lack\\nof good control initializations that are needed to ensure that\\nthe network starts off with a meaningful segmentation - given\\nzero controls the SE3-N ET can choose not to segment the\\narm at all, and finally 5) Good performance of SE3-P OSE N ETS indicates that the learned pose space is consistent\\nacross large motions and can be used for fast reactive control,\\nalbeit not quite as robust as the baseline methods given data\\nassociations. SE3-P OSE -N ETS fail to minimize the pose error\\non one of the tested configurations leading to an increasing\\nerror in Fig. 4, left. Our termination check that looks for\\nincreasing pose errors does correctly identify this case and\\nwe are able to succeed on all the other examples (Fig. 4,\\nmiddle). We discuss ways to further improve the robustness\\nof our approach in Sec. VI.\\nReal robot results: We further test the control performance using SE3-P OSE -N ETS on a few real world examples.\\nWe do not compare to any baselines as they need an explicit\\nexternal data association system to be feasible. On the real\\nrobot, we restrict ourselves to controlling the first four joints\\nof the right arm using the SE3-P OSE -N ET and control the\\nfirst six joints using the model that additionally takes in joint\\nangles as input. Fig. 5 shows the errors as a function of the\\niteration count. Both models converge very quickly which\\nindicates that our network is able to control robustly even\\nin the presence of sensor noise and unmodeled dynamics.\\nSurprisingly, there is very little difference between GN and\\nBackprop algorithms on the real data. A video showing realtime control results on the Baxter can be found here.\\nSpeed: SE3-P OSE -N ETS optimize errors directly in\\n\\n\fthe low-dimensional pose space for control. This leads to\\nsignificant speedups compared to the baselines: while both the\\nflow and SE3-N ETS can operate at around 10Hz (excluding\\nthe data-association pipeline), SE3-P OSE -N ETS run in realtime (30Hz) including the pose detection part.\\nVI. D ISCUSSION\\nThis paper presents SE3-P OSE -N ETS, a framework for\\nlearning predictive models that enable control of objects in\\na scene. In the context of a robot manipulator, we showed\\nthey solve this problem by learning a predictive model for\\nthe individual parts of the manipulator, as in prior work\\n[4]. Additionally, SE3-P OSE -N ETS learn a consistent pose\\nspace for these parts, essentially learning to detect the 6D\\nposes of manipulator parts in the raw depth images. This\\ndetection capability enables SE3-P OSE -N ETS to solve the\\ndata association problem that is crucial for relating the\\ncurrent observation of the manipulator to a desired target\\nobservation. The difference between these poses can be\\nused to generate control signals to move the manipulator\\nto its target pose, similar to visual servoing applied to\\nan image of the manipulator. We also showed how the\\nlearned network can be used to determine the gradients\\nneeded for the control signals. Our experiments show that\\nSE3-P OSE -N ETS generate control superior to representations\\nlearned by previous techniques, even when these are provided\\nwith external data associations. Furthermore, in addition to\\nproviding data associations, SE3-P OSE -N ETS allow us to\\ncompute controls directly in the low dimensional pose space,\\nenabling far more efficient control than techniques that operate\\nin the raw perception space. Crucially, all these abilities are\\nlearned in a single framework based on raw data traces solely\\nannotated with frame-to-frame point cloud correspondences.\\nOverall, the control performance shown by our SE3-P OSE N ETS is extremely encouraging and provides a strong proof of\\nconcept that such networks can learn a consistent pose space\\nthat provides long-range correspondences and fast reactive\\ncontrol. While this provides reason to rejoice, there are a\\nmultiple areas for improvement: 1) As shown in the real\\nrobot results, SE3-P OSE -N ETS (and other baselines) have\\ndifficulties handling joints further down the kinematic chain\\n(joints 4,5,6 for the Baxter) whose motions are significantly\\ncorrelated to the motions of the joints above. Additionally,\\nthe end-effector has poor visibility on depth images. Adding\\nstate information in the form of encoder data significantly\\nalleviates this issue but does not fully solve it. There are\\npotentially multiple ways to improve the model to tackle this\\nproblem, including curriculum and active learning along with\\nbetter regularization and physical grounding of the pose space\\nto remove inconsistencies. 2) A key area for future work is in\\nextending our system to interact with and manipulate external\\nobjects. Here, a consistent pose space for objects in the scene\\nwill enable the robot to plan its motion toward the objects,\\nenabling smooth interactions. 3) Finally, while we have shown\\nthat SE3-P OSE -N ETS can be used for single-step reactive\\ncontrol, we would like to do long-term planning using model\\nbased techniques such as iterative LQG [23] to leverage the\\n\\nfull strength the latent pose space, i.e., fast real-time rollouts\\ndirectly in the pose space.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis work was funded in part by the National Science\\nFoundation under contract number NSF-NRI-1637479 and\\nSTTR number 1622958 awarded to LULA robotics.

In our work we present a systematic,\\nunifying taxonomy to categorize existing methods. We distinguish methods\\nthat aﬀect data, network architectures, error terms, regularization terms,\\nand optimization procedures. We do not provide all details about the listed\\nmethods; instead, we present an overview of how the methods can be sorted\\ninto meaningful categories and sub-categories. This helps revealing links\\nand fundamental similarities between them. Finally, we include practical\\nrecommendations both for users and for developers of new regularization\\nmethods.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nRegularization is one of the key elements of machine learning, particularly of deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2016), allowing to generalize well to unseen data even when training\\non a ﬁnite training set or with an imperfect optimization procedure. In the traditional sense\\nof optimization and also in older neural networks literature, the term “regularization” is\\nreserved solely for a penalty term in the loss function (Bishop, 1995a). Recently, the term\\nhas adopted a broader meaning: Goodfellow et al. (2016, Chap. 5) loosely deﬁne it as “any\\nmodification we make to a learning algorithm that is intended to reduce its test error but\\nnot its training error”. We ﬁnd this deﬁnition slightly restrictive and present our working\\ndeﬁnition of regularization, since many techniques considered as regularization do reduce\\nthe training error (e.g. weight decay in AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012)).\\nDeﬁnition 1. Regularization is any supplementary technique that aims at making the\\nmodel generalize better, i.e. produce better results on the test set.\\nThis can include various properties of the loss function, the loss optimization algorithm, or\\nother techniques. Note that this deﬁnition is more in line with machine learning literature\\nthan with inverse problems literature, the latter using a more restrictive deﬁnition.\\nBefore we proceed to the presentation of our taxonomy, we revisit some basic machine learning theory in Section 2. This will provide a justiﬁcation of the top level of the taxonomy. In\\nSections 3–7, we continue with a ﬁner division of the individual classes of the regularization\\ntechniques, followed by our practical recommendations in Section 8. We are aware that the\\nmany research works discussed in this taxonomy cannot be summarized in a single sentence.\\nFor the sake of structuring the multitude of papers, we decided to merely describe a certain\\nsubset of their properties according to the focus of our taxonomy.\\n1\\n\\n\f2\\n\\nTheoretical framework\\n\\nThe central task of our interest is model ﬁtting: ﬁnding a function f that can well approximate a desired mapping from inputs x to desired outputs f (x). A given input x can have\\nan associated target t which dictates the desired output f (x) directly (or in some applications indirectly (Ulyanov et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016)). A typical example of having\\navailable targets t is supervised learning. Data samples (x, t) then follow a ground truth\\nprobability distribution P .\\nIn many applications, neural networks have proven to be a good family of functions to\\nchoose f from. A neural network is a function fw : x 7→ y with trainable weights w ∈ W .\\nTraining the network means ﬁnding a weight conﬁguration w∗ minimizing a loss function\\nL : W → R as follows:\\nw∗ = arg min L(w).\\n(1)\\nw\\n\\nUsually the loss function takes the form of expected risk :\\nh\\ni\\n\u0001\\nL = E(x,t)∼P E fw (x), t + R(. . .) ,\\n\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere we identify two parts, an error function E and a regularization term R. The error\\nfunction depends on the targets and assigns a penalty to model predictions according to\\ntheir consistency with the targets. The regularization term assigns a penalty to the model\\nbased on other criteria. It may depend on anything except the targets, for example on the\\nweights (see Section 6).\\nThe expected risk cannot be minimized directly since the data distribution P is unknown.\\nInstead, a training set D sampled from the distribution is given. The minimization of the\\nexpected risk can be then approximated by minimizing the empirical risk L̂:\\nX\\n\u0001\\n1\\narg min\\nE f w (xi ), ti + R(. . .)\\n(3)\\n|D|\\nw\\n(xi ,ti )∈D\\n\\nwhere (xi , ti ) are samples from D.\\nNow we have the minimal background to formalize the division of regularization methods\\ninto a systematic taxonomy. In the minimization of the empirical risk, Eq. (3), we can\\nidentify the following elements that are responsible for the value of the learned weights, and\\nthus can contribute to regularization:\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nD: The training set, discussed in Section 3\\nf : The selected model family, discussed in Section 4\\nE: The error function, brieﬂy discussed in Section 5\\nR: The regularization term, discussed in Section 6\\nThe optimization procedure itself, discussed in Section 7\\n\\nAmbiguity regarding the splitting of methods into these categories and their subcategories\\nis discussed in Appendix A using notation from Section 3.\\n\\n3\\n\\nRegularization via data\\n\\nThe quality of a trained model depends largely on the training data. Apart from acquisition/selection of appropriate training data, it is possible to employ regularization via data.\\nThis is done by applying some transformation to the training set D, resulting in a new\\nset DR . Some transformations perform feature extraction or pre-processing, modifying the\\nfeature space or the distribution of the data to some representation simplifying the learning\\ntask. Other methods allow generating new samples to create a larger, possibly inﬁnite,\\naugmented dataset. These two principles are somewhat independent and may be combined.\\nThe goal of regularization via data is either one of them, or the other, or both. They both\\nrely on transformations with (stochastic) parameters:\\n2\\n\\n\fDeﬁnition 2. Transformation with stochastic parameters is a function τθ with parameters θ which follow some probability distribution.\\nIn this context we consider τθ which can operate on network inputs, activations in hidden layers, or targets. An example of a transformation with stochastic parameters is the\\ncorruption of inputs by Gaussian noise (Bishop, 1995b; An, 1996):\\nθ ∼ N (0, Σ).\\n\\nτθ (x) = x + θ,\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe stochasticity of the transformation parameters is responsible for generating new samples, i.e. data augmentation. Note that the term data augmentation often refers speciﬁcally\\nto transformations of inputs or hidden activations, but here we also list transformations of\\ntargets for completeness. The exception to the stochasticity is when θ follows a delta distribution, in which case the transformation parameters become deterministic and the dataset\\nsize is not augmented.\\nWe can categorize the data-based methods according to the properties of the used transformation and of the distribution of its parameters. We identify the following criteria for\\ncategorization (some of them later serve as columns in Tables 1–2):\\nStochasticity of the transformation parameters θ\\n• Deterministic parameters: Parameters θ follow a delta distribution, size of the\\ndataset remains unchanged\\n• Stochastic parameters: Allow generation of a larger, possibly inﬁnite, dataset. Various strategies for sampling of θ exist:\\n– Random: Draw a random θ from the speciﬁed distribution\\n– Adaptive: Value of θ is the result of an optimization procedure, usually with\\nthe objective of maximizing the network error on the transformed sample (such\\n“challenging” sample is considered to be the most informative one at current\\ntraining stage), or minimizing the diﬀerence between the network prediction\\nand a predeﬁned fake target t′\\n∗ Constrained optimization: θ found by maximizing error under hard constraints (support of the distribution of θ controls the strongest allowed\\ntransformation)\\n∗ Unconstrained optimization: θ found by maximizing modiﬁed error function, using the distribution of θ as weighting (proposed herein for completeness, not yet tested)\\n∗ Stochastic: θ found by taking a ﬁxed number of samples of θ and using the\\none yielding the highest error\\nEﬀect on the data representation\\n• Representation-preserving transformations: Preserve the feature space and attempt\\nto preserve the data distribution\\n• Representation-modifying transformations: Map the data to a diﬀerent representation (diﬀerent distribution or even new feature space) that may disentangle the\\nunderlying factors of the original representation and make the learning problem\\neasier\\nTransformation space\\n• Input: Transformation is applied to x\\n• Hidden-feature space: Transformation is applied to some deep-layer representation\\nof samples (this also uses parts of f and w to map the input into the hidden-feature\\nspace; such transformations act inside the network fw and thus can be considered\\npart of the architecture, additionally ﬁtting Section 4)\\n• Target: Transformation is applied to t (can only be used during the training phase\\nsince labels are not shown to the model at test time)\\n3\\n\\n\fUniversality\\n• Generic: Applicable to all data domains\\n• Domain-speciﬁc: Speciﬁc (handcrafted) for the problem at hand, for example image\\nrotations\\nDependence of the distribution of θ\\n• p(θ): distribution of θ is the same for all samples\\n• p(θ|t): distribution of θ can be diﬀerent for each target (class)\\n• p(θ|t′ ): distribution of θ depends on desired (fake) target t′\\n• p(θ|x): distribution of θ can be diﬀerent for each input vector (with implicit dependence on f and w if the transformation is in hidden-feature space)\\n• p(θ|D): distribution of θ depends on the whole training dataset\\n• p(θ|x): distribution of θ depends on a batch of training inputs (for example\\n(parts of) the current mini-batch, or also previous mini-batches)\\n• p(θ|time): distribution of θ depends on time (current training iteration)\\n• p(θ|π): distribution of θ depends on some trainable parameters π subject to loss\\nminimization (i.e. the parameters π evolve during training along with the network\\nweights w)\\n• Combinations of the above, e.g. p(θ|x, t), p(θ|x, π), p(θ|x, t′ ), p(θ|x, D), p(θ|t, D),\\np(θ|x, t, D)\\nPhase\\n• Training: Transformation of training samples\\n• Test: Transformation of test samples, for example multiple augmented variants of\\na sample are classiﬁed and the result is aggregated over them\\nA review of existing methods that use generic transformations can be found in Table 1.\\nDropout in its original form (Hinton et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014) is one of the\\nmost popular methods from the generic group, but also several variants of Dropout have\\nbeen proposed that provide additional theoretical motivation and improved empirical results\\n(Standout (Ba and Frey, 2013), Random dropout probability (Bouthillier et al., 2015),\\nBayesian dropout (Maeda, 2014), Test-time dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016)).\\nTable 2 contains a list of some domain-speciﬁc methods focused especially on the image\\ndomain. Here the most used method is rigid and elastic image deformation.\\nTarget-preserving data augmentation In the following, we discuss an important group\\nof methods: target-preserving data augmentation. These methods use stochastic transformations in input and hidden-feature spaces, while preserving the original target t. As can\\nbe seen in the respective two columns in Tables 1–2, most of the listed methods have exactly\\nthese properties. These methods transform the training set to a distribution Q, which is\\nused for training instead. In other words, the training samples (xi , ti ) ∈ D are replaced in\\nthe empirical risk loss function (Eq. (3)) by augmented training samples (τθ (xi ), ti ) ∼ Q.\\nBy randomly sampling the transformation parameters θ and thus creating many new samples (τθ (xi ), ti ) from each original training sample (xi , ti ), data augmentation attempts to\\nbridge the limited-data gap between the expected and the empirical risk, Eqs. (2)–(3). While\\nunlimited sampling from Q provides more data than the original dataset D, both of them\\nusually are merely approximations of the ground truth data distribution or of an ideal training dataset; both D and Q have their own distinct biases, advantages and disadvantages.\\nFor example, elastic image deformations result in images that are not perfectly realistic;\\nthis is not necessarily a disadvantage, but it is a bias compared to the ground truth data\\ndistribution; in any case, the advantages (having more training data) often prevail. In some\\ncases, it may be even desired for Q to be deliberately different from the ground truth data\\n4\\n\\n\fMethod\\n\\nDependence Transformation Stochasticity Phase\\nspace\\n(θ sampling)\\n\\nGaussian noise on input\\n(Bishop, 1995a; An, 1996)\\nGaussian noise on hidden units\\n(DeVries and Taylor, 2017)\\nDropout (Hinton et al., 2012; Srivastava\\net al., 2014)\\nRandom dropout probability\\n(Bouthillier et al., 2015, Sec. 4)\\nCurriculum dropout\\n(Morerio et al., 2017)\\nBayesian dropout\\n(Maeda, 2014)\\nStandout (adaptive dropout)\\n(Ba and Frey, 2013)\\n“Projection” of dropout noise into input\\nspace (Bouthillier et al., 2015, Sec. 3)\\n\\np(θ)\\n\\nInput\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ)\\n\\nHidden features Random\\n\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ)\\n\\nInput and\\nhidden features\\nInput and\\nhidden features\\nInput and\\nhidden features\\nInput and\\nhidden features\\nInput and\\nhidden features\\nInput\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nRandom\\n\\nTraining\\n\\nApproximation of Gaussian process by\\ntest-time dropout\\n(Gal and Ghahramani, 2016)\\nStochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016b)\\nNoisy activation functions\\n(Nair and Hinton, 2010; Xu et al., 2015;\\nGülçehre et al., 2016a)\\nTraining with adversarial examples\\n(Szegedy et al., 2014)\\nNetwork fooling (adversarial examples)\\n(Szegedy et al., 2014)\\n(Not for regularization)\\nSynthetic minority oversampling in\\nhidden-feature space (Wong et al., 2016)\\nInter- and extrapolation in hidden-feature\\nspace (DeVries and Taylor, 2017)\\nBatch normalization (Ioﬀe and Szegedy,\\n2015), Ghost batch normalization (Hoﬀer\\net al., 2017)\\nLayer normalization\\n(Ba et al., 2016)\\nAnnealed noise on targets\\n(Wang and Principe, 1999)\\nLabel smoothing (Szegedy et al., 2016,\\nSec. 7; Goodfellow et al., 2016, Chap. 7)\\nModel compression (mimic models,\\ndistilled models) (Bucilă et al., 2006; Ba\\nand Caruana, 2014; Hinton et al., 2015)\\n\\np(θ)\\n\\nInput and\\nRandom\\nhidden features\\n\\nTest\\n\\np(θ)\\np(θ|x)\\n\\nHidden features Random\\nHidden features Random\\n\\nTraining\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ|x, t′ )\\n\\nInput\\n\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ)\\np(θ|time)\\np(θ|π)\\np(θ|x, π)\\np(θ|x, f, w)\\n\\nUses auxiliary τ\\nin hidden-feature\\nspace.\\n\\nAdaptive\\nConstrained\\n\\np(θ|x, t′ )\\n\\nInput\\n\\nAdaptive\\n\\nTest\\n\\nConstrained\\n\\np(θ|x, t, D)\\n\\nHidden features Random\\n\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ|x, t, D)\\n\\nHidden features Random\\n\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ|x)\\n\\nHidden features Deterministic Training\\nand test\\n\\np(θ|x)\\np(θ|time)\\n\\nHidden features Deterministic Training\\nand test\\nTarget\\nRandom\\nTraining\\n\\np(θ)\\n\\nTarget\\n\\nDeterministic Training\\n\\np(θ|x, D)\\n\\nTarget\\n\\nDeterministic Training\\n\\nTable 1: Existing generic data-based methods classiﬁed according to our taxonomy.

For example, in case of class imbalance (unbalanced abundance or importance\\nof classes), a common regularization strategy is to undersample or oversample the data,\\nsometimes leading to a less realistic Q but better models.

We provide more details about the transition from D to Q in Appendix B.\\nSummary of data-based methods Data-based regularization is a popular and very\\nuseful way to improve the results of deep learning. In this section we formalized this group\\nof methods and showed that seemingly unrelated techniques such as Target-preserving data\\naugmentation, Dropout, or Batch normalization are methodologically surprisingly close to\\neach other. In Section 8 we discuss future directions that we ﬁnd promising.\\n\\n4\\n\\nRegularization via the network architecture\\n\\nA network architecture f can be selected to have certain properties or match certain assumptions in order to have a regularizing eﬀect.1\\nAssumptions about the mapping An input-output mapping fw must have certain\\nproperties in order to ﬁt the data P well. Although it may be intractable to enforce the\\nprecise properties of an ideal mapping, it may be possible to approximate them by simpliﬁed\\nassumptions about the mapping. These properties and assumptions can then be imposed\\nupon model ﬁtting in a hard or soft manner. This limits the search space of models and\\nallows ﬁnding better solutions. An example is the decision about the number of layers and\\n1\\nThe network architecture is represented by a function f : (w, x) 7→ y, and together with\\nthe set W of all its possible weight conﬁgurations deﬁnes a set of mappings that this particular\\narchitecture can realize: {fw : x 7→ y | ∀w ∈ W }.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\fMethod\\n\\nMethod class\\n\\nAssumptions about an appropriate learnable input-output mapping\\n\\nAny chosen (not overly\\ncomplex) architecture\\n\\n*\\n\\nMapping can be well approximated by functions from the chosen family\\nwhich are easily accessible by optimization.\\n\\nSmall network\\n\\n*\\n\\nMapping is simple (complexity of the mapping depends on the number of\\nnetwork units and layers).\\n\\nDeep network\\n\\n*\\n\\nThe mapping is complex, but can be decomposed into a composition (or\\ngenerally into a directed acyclic graph) of simple nonlinear transformations,\\ne.g. affine transformation followed by simple nonlinearity (fully-connected\\nlayer), “multi-channel convolution” followed by simple nonlinearity (convolutional layer), etc.\\n\\nHard bottleneck (layer with\\nfew neurons); soft bottleneck\\n(e.g. Jacobian penalty (Rifai\\net al., 2011c), see Section 6)\\n\\nLayer operation Data concentrates around a lower-dimensional manifold; has few factors of\\nvariation.\\n\\nConvolutional networks\\nLayer operation Spatially local and shift-equivariant feature extraction is all we need.\\n(Fukushima and Miyake, 1982;\\nRumelhart et al., 1986,\\npp. 348-352; LeCun et al.,\\n1989; Simard et al., 2003)\\nDilated convolutions\\n(Yu and Koltun, 2015)\\n\\nLayer operation Like convolutional networks.

Appendix A).\\n\\n7\\n\\n\funits, which allows the mapping to be neither too simple nor too complex (thus avoiding\\nunderﬁtting and overﬁtting). Another example are certain invariances of the mapping, such\\nas locality and shift-equivariance of feature extraction hardwired in convolutional layers.\\nOverall, the approach of imposing assumptions about the input-output mapping discussed\\nin this section is the selection of the network architecture f . The choice of architecture f\\non the one hand hardwires certain properties of the mapping; additionally, in an interplay\\nbetween f and the optimization algorithm (Section 7), certain weight conﬁgurations are\\nmore likely accessible by optimization than others, further limiting the likely search space\\nin a soft way. A complementary way of imposing certain assumptions about the mapping\\nare regularization terms (Section 6), as well as invariances present in the (augmented) data\\nset (Section 3).\\nAssumptions can be hardwired into the deﬁnition of the operation performed by certain\\nlayers, and/or into the connections between layers. This distinction is made in Table 3,\\nwhere these and other methods are listed.\\nIn Section 3 about data, we mentioned regularization methods that transform data in the\\nhidden-feature space. They can be considered part of the architecture. In other words, they\\nﬁt both Sections 3 (data) and 4 (architecture). These methods are listed in Table 1 with\\nhidden features as their transformation space.\\nWeight sharing Reusing a certain trainable parameter in several parts of the network\\nis referred to as weight sharing. This usually makes the model less complex than using\\nseparately trainable parameters. An example are convolutional networks (LeCun et al.,\\n1989). Here the weight sharing does not merely reduce the number of weights that need to\\nbe learned; it also encodes the prior knowledge about the shift-equivariance and locality of\\nfeature extraction. Another example is weight sharing in autoencoders.\\nActivation functions Choosing the right activation function is quite important; for example, using Rectiﬁed linear units (ReLUs) improved the performance of many deep architectures both in the sense of training times and accuracy (Jarrett et al., 2009; Nair and\\nHinton, 2010; Glorot et al., 2011). The success of ReLUs can be attributed to the fact that\\nthey help avoiding the vanishing gradient problem, but also to the fact that they provide\\nmore expressive families of mappings (the classical sigmoid nonlinearity can be approximated very well2 with only two ReLUs, but it takes an inﬁnite number of sigmoid units to\\napproximate a ReLU) and their aﬃne extrapolation to unknown regions of data space seems\\nto provide better generalization in practice than the “stagnating” extrapolation of sigmoid\\nunits. Some activation functions were designed explicitly for regularization. For Dropout,\\nMaxout units (Goodfellow et al., 2013) allow a more precise approximation of the geometric\\nmean of the model ensemble predictions at test time. Stochastic pooling (Zeiler and Fergus,\\n2013), on the other hand, is a noisy version of max-pooling. The authors claim that this\\nallows modelling distributions of activations instead of taking just the maximum.\\nNoisy models Stochastic pooling was one example of a stochastic generalization of a\\ndeterministic model. Some models are stochastic by injecting random noise into various\\nparts of the model. The most frequently used noisy model is Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012;\\nSrivastava et al., 2014).\\nMulti-task learning A special type of regularization is multi-task learning (see Caruana,\\n1998; Ruder, 2017). It can be combined with semi-supervised learning to utilize unlabeled\\ndata on an auxiliary task (Rasmus et al., 2015). A similar concept of sharing knowledge\\nbetween tasks is also utilized in meta-learning, where multiple tasks from the same domain\\nare learned sequentially, using previously gained knowledge as bias for new tasks (Baxter,\\n2000); and transfer learning, where knowledge from one domain is transferred into another\\ndomain (Pan and Yang, 2010).\\n2\\nSmall integrated squared error, small integrated absolute error. A simple example is sigm(x) ≈\\nReLU(x + 0.5) − ReLU(x − 0.5).\\n\\n8\\n\\n\fModel selection The best among several trained models (e.g. with diﬀerent architectures) can be selected by evaluating the predictions on a validation set. It should be noted\\nthat this holds for selecting the best combination of all techniques (Sections 3–7), not just\\narchitecture; and that the validation set used for model selection in the “outer loop” should\\nbe diﬀerent from the validation set used e.g. for Early stopping (Section 7), and diﬀerent from the test set (Cawley and Talbot, 2010). However, there are also model selection\\nmethods that speciﬁcally target the selection of the number of units in a speciﬁc network architecture, e.g. using network growing and network pruning (see Bishop, 1995a, Sec. 9.5), or\\nadditionally do not require a validation set, e.g. the Network information criterion to compare models based on the training error and second derivatives of the loss function (Murata\\net al., 1994).\\n\\n5\\n\\nRegularization via the error function\\n\\nIdeally, the error function E reﬂects an appropriate notion of quality, and in some cases\\nsome assumptions about the data distribution. Typical examples are mean squared error\\nor cross-entropy. The error function E can also have a regularizing eﬀect. An example\\nis Dice coeﬃcient optimization (Milletari et al., 2016) which is robust to class imbalance.\\nMoreover, the overall form of the loss function can be diﬀerent than Eq. (3). For example,\\nin certain loss functions that are robust to class imbalance, the sum is taken over pairwise\\ncombinations D×D of training samples (Yan et al., 2003), rather than over training samples.\\nBut such alternatives to Eq. (3) are rather rare, and similar principles apply. If additional\\ntasks are added for a regularizing eﬀect (multi-task learning (see Caruana, 1998; Ruder,\\n2017)), then targets t are modiﬁed to consist of several tasks, the mapping fw is modiﬁed\\nto produce an according output y, and E is modiﬁed to account for the modiﬁed t and y.\\nBesides, there are regularization terms that depend on ∂E/∂x. They depend on t and thus\\nin our deﬁnition are considered part of E rather than of R, but they are listed in Section 6\\namong R (rather than here) for a better overview.\\n\\n6\\n\\nRegularization via the regularization term\\n\\nRegularization can be achieved by adding a regularizer R into the loss function. Unlike the\\nerror function E (which expresses consistency of outputs with targets), the regularization\\nterm is independent of the targets. Instead, it is used to encode other properties of the\\ndesired model, to provide inductive bias (i.e. assumptions about the mapping other than\\nconsistency of outputs with targets). The value of R can thus be computed for an unlabeled\\ntest sample, whereas the value of E cannot.\\nThe independence of R from t has an important implication: it allows additionally using\\nunlabeled samples (semi-supervised learning) to improve the learned model based on its\\ncompliance with some desired properties (Sajjadi et al., 2016). For example, semi-supervised\\nlearning with ladder networks (Rasmus et al., 2015) combines a supervised task with an\\nunsupervised auxiliary denoising task in a “multi-task” learning fashion. (For alternative\\ninterpretations, see Appendix A.) Unlabeled samples are extremely useful when labeled\\nsamples are scarce. A Bayesian perspective on the combination of labeled and unlabeled\\ndata in a semi-supervised manner is oﬀered by Lasserre et al. (2006).\\nA classical regularizer is weight decay (see Plaut et al., 1986; Lang and Hinton, 1990; Goodfellow et al., 2016, Chap. 7):\\n1\\nR(w) = λ kwk22 ,\\n(5)\\n2\\nwhere λ is a weighting term controlling the importance of the regularization over the consistency. From the Bayesian perspective, weight decay corresponds to using a symmetric\\nmultivariate normal distribution as prior for the weights: p(w) = N \u0001(w|0, λ−1 I) (Nowlan\\nand Hinton, 1992). Indeed, − log N (w|0, λ−1 I) ∝ − log exp − λ2 kwk22 = λ2 kwk22 = R(w).\\nWeight decay has gained big popularity, and it is being successfully used; Krizhevsky et al.\\n(2012) even observe reduction of the error on the training set.\\n9\\n\\n\fAnother common prior assumption that can be expressed via the regularization term is\\n“smoothness” of the learned mapping (see Bengio et al., 2013, Section 3.2): if x1 ≈ x2 , then\\nfw (x1 ) ≈ fw (x2 ). It can be expressed by the following loss term:\\nR(fw , x) = kJfw (x)k2F ,\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nwhere k·kF denotes the Frobenius norm, and Jfw (x) is the Jacobian of the neural network\\ninput-to-output mapping fw for some ﬁxed network weights w. This term penalizes mappings with large derivatives, and is used in contractive autoencoders (Rifai et al., 2011c).\\nThe domain of loss regularizers is very heterogeneous. We propose a natural way to categorize them by their dependence. We saw in Eq. (5) that weight decay depends on w\\nonly, whereas the Jacobian penalty in Eq. (6) depends on w, f , and x. More precisely, the\\nJacobian penalty uses the derivative ∂y/∂x of output y = fw (x) w.r.t. input x. (We use\\nvector-by-vector derivative notation from matrix calculus, i.e. ∂y/∂x = ∂fw (x)/∂x = Jfw is\\nthe Jacobian of fw with ﬁxed weights w.) We identify the following dependencies of R:\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n•\\n\\nDependence on the weights w\\nDependence on the network output y = fw (x)\\nDependence on the derivative ∂y/∂w of the output y = fw (x) w.r.t. the weights w\\nDependence on the derivative ∂y/∂x of the output y = fw (x) w.r.t. the input x\\nDependence on the derivative ∂E/∂x of the error term E w.r.t. the input x (E depends on t, and according to our deﬁnition such methods belong to Section 5, but\\nthey are listed here for overview)\\n\\nA review of existing methods can be found in Table 4. Weight decay seems to be still the\\nmost popular of the regularization terms. Some of the methods are equivalent or nearly\\nequivalent to other methods from diﬀerent taxonomy branches. For example, Tangent prop\\nsimulates minimal data augmentation (Simard et al., 1992); Injection of small-variance\\nGaussian noise (Bishop, 1995b; An, 1996) is an approximation of Jacobian penalty (Rifai\\net al., 2011c); and Fast dropout (Wang and Manning, 2013) is (in shallow networks) a\\ndeterministic approximation of Dropout. This is indicated in the Equivalence column in\\nTable 4.\\n\\n7\\n\\nRegularization via optimization\\n\\nThe last class of the regularization methods according to our taxonomy is the regularization\\nthrough optimization. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) (see Bottou, 1998) (along with\\nits derivations) is the most frequently used optimization algorithm in the context of deep\\nneural networks and is the center of our attention. We also list some alternative methods\\nbelow.\\nStochastic gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm using the following update\\nrule:\\nwt+1 = wt − ηt ∇w L(wt , dt ),\\n(7)\\nwhere ∇L(wt , dt ) is the gradient of the loss L evaluated on a mini-batch dt from the training\\nset D. It is frequently used in combination with momentum and other tweaks improving\\nthe convergence speed (see Wilson et al., 2017). Moreover, the noise induced by the varying\\nmini-batches helps the algorithm escape saddle points (Ge et al., 2015); this can be further\\nreinforced by adding supplementary gradient noise (Neelakantan et al., 2015; Chaudhari and\\nSoatto, 2015).\\nIf the algorithm reaches a low training error in a reasonable time (linear in the size of the\\ntraining set, allowing multiple passes through D), the solution generalizes well under certain\\nmild assumptions; in that sense SGD works as an implicit regularizer : a short training time\\nprevents overﬁtting even without any additional regularizer used (Hardt et al., 2016). This\\nis in line with (Zhang et al., 2017) who ﬁnd in a series of experiments that regularization\\n(such as Dropout, data augmentation, and weight decay) is by itself neither necessary nor\\nsuﬃcient for good generalization.\\n10\\n\\n\fDependency\\n\\nMethod\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nWeight decay (see Plaut et al.,\\n1986; Lang and Hinton, 1990;\\nGoodfellow et al., 2016, Chap. 7)\\n\\nL2 norm on network weights (not\\nbiases).\\nFavors smaller weights,\\nthus for usual architectures tends ✖\\nto make the mapping less “extreme”,\\nmore robust to noise in the input.\\n\\nWeight smoothing\\n(Lang and Hinton, 1990)\\n\\nPenalizes L2 norm of gradients\\nof learned filters, making them ✖\\nsmooth.

Methods that depend\\non ∂E/∂x implicitly depend on targets t and thus can be considered part of the error\\nfunction (Section 5) rather than regularization term (Section 6).\\n\\n11\\n\\n\fWe divide the methods into three groups: initialization/warm-start methods, update methods, and termination methods, discussed in the following.\\nInitialization and warm-start methods These methods aﬀect the initial selection of\\nthe model weights. Currently the most frequently used method is sampling the initial\\nweights from a carefully tuned distribution. There are multiple strategies based on the\\narchitecture choice, aiming at keeping the variance of activations in all layers around 1, thus\\npreventing vanishing or exploding activations (and gradients) in deeper layers (Glorot and\\nBengio, 2010, Sec. 4.2; He et al., 2015).\\nAnother (complementary) option is pre-training on diﬀerent data, or with a diﬀerent objective, or with partially diﬀerent architecture. This can prime the learning algorithm towards\\na good solution before the ﬁne-tuning on the actual objective starts. Pre-training the model\\non a diﬀerent task in the same domain may lead to learning useful features, making the primary task easier. However, pre-trained models are also often misused as a lazy approach to\\nproblems where training from scratch or using thorough domain adaptation, transfer learning, or multi-task learning methods would be worth trying. On the other hand, pre-training\\nor similar techniques may be a useful part of such methods.\\nFinally, with some methods such as Curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009), the transition\\nbetween pre-training and ﬁne-tuning is smooth. We refer to them as warm-start methods.\\n• Initialization without pre-training\\n– Random weight initialization (Rumelhart et al., 1986, p. 330; Glorot and Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015; Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016)\\n– Orthogonal weight matrices (Saxe et al., 2013)\\n– Data-dependent weight initialization (Krähenbühl et al., 2015)\\n• Initialization with pre-training\\n– Greedy layer-wise pre-training (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007; Erhan et al., 2010) (has become less important due to advances (e.g. ReLUs) in\\neﬀective end-to-end training that optimizes all parameters simultaneously)\\n– Curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009)\\n– Spatial contrasting (Hoﬀer et al., 2016)\\n– Subtask splitting (Gülçehre and Bengio, 2016)\\nUpdate methods This class of methods aﬀects individual weight updates. There are two\\ncomplementary subgroups: Update rules modify the form of the update formula; Weight and\\ngradient filters are methods that aﬀect the value of the gradient or weights, which are used\\nin the update formula, e.g. by injecting noise into the gradient (Neelakantan et al., 2015).\\nAgain, it is not entirely clear which of the methods only speed up the optimization and\\nwhich actually help the generalization. Wilson et al. (2017) show that some of the methods\\nsuch as AdaGrad or Adam even lose the regularization abilities of SGD.\\n• Update rules\\n– Momentum, Nesterov’s accelerated gradient method, AdaGrad, AdaDelta,\\nRMSProp, Adam—overview in (Wilson et al., 2017)\\n– Learning rate schedules (Girosi et al., 1995; Hoﬀer et al., 2017)\\n– Online batch selection (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2015)\\n– SGD alternatives: L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989; Le et al., 2011), Hessianfree methods (Martens, 2010), Sum-of-functions optimizer (Sohl-Dickstein\\net al., 2014), ProxProp (Frerix et al., 2017)\\n• Gradient and weight ﬁlters\\n– Annealed Langevin noise (Neelakantan et al., 2015)\\n– AnnealSGD (Chaudhari and Soatto, 2015)\\n– Dropout (Hinton et al., 2012; Srivastava et al., 2014) corresponds to optimization steps in subspaces of weight space, see Figure 1\\n12\\n\\n\fw2\\n\\nFigure 1: Eﬀect of Dropout on\\nweight optimization. Starting\\nfrom the current weight conﬁguration (red dot), all weights of\\ncertain neurons are set to zero\\n(black arrow), descent step is\\nperformed in that subspace (teal\\narrow), and then the discarded\\nweight-space coordinates are restored (blue arrow).\\n\\nw1\\n\\n– Annealed noise on targets (Wang and Principe, 1999) (works as noise on gradient, but belongs rather to data-based methods, Section 3)\\nTermination methods There are numerous possible stopping criteria and selecting the\\nright moment to stop the optimization procedure may improve the generalization by reducing\\nthe error caused by the discrepancy between the minimizers of expected and empirical risk:\\nThe network ﬁrst learns general concepts that work for all samples from the ground truth\\ndistribution P before ﬁtting the speciﬁc sample D and its noise (Krueger et al., 2017).\\nThe most successful and popular termination methods put a portion of the labeled data\\naside as a validation set and use it to evaluate performance (validation error ). The most\\nprominent example is Early stopping (see Prechelt, 1998). In scenarios where the training\\ndata are scarce it is possible to resort to termination methods that do not use a validation\\nset. The simplest case is ﬁxing the number of passes through the training set.\\n• Termination using a validation set\\n– Early stopping (see Morgan and Bourlard, 1990; Prechelt, 1998)\\n– Choice of validation set size based on test set size (Amari et al., 1997)\\n• Termination without using a validation set\\n– Fixed number of iterations\\n– Optimized approximation algorithm (Liu et al., 2008)\\n\\n8\\n\\nRecommendations, discussion, conclusions\\n\\nWe see the main beneﬁts of our taxonomy to be two-fold: Firstly, it provides an overview\\nof the existing techniques to the users of regularization methods and gives them a better\\nidea of how to choose the ideal combination of regularization techniques for their problem.\\nSecondly, it is useful for development of new methods, as it gives a comprehensive overview\\nof the main principles that can be exploited to regularize the models. We summarize our\\nrecommendations in the following paragraphs:\\nRecommendations for users of existing regularization methods Overall, using the\\ninformation contained in data as well as prior knowledge as much as possible, and primarily\\nstarting with popular methods, the following procedure can be helpful:\\n• Common recommendations for the ﬁrst steps:\\n– Deep learning is about disentangling the factors of variation. An appropriate\\ndata representation should be chosen; known meaningful data transformations\\nshould not be outsourced to the learning. Redundantly providing the same\\ninformation in several representations is okay.\\n– Output nonlinearity and error function should reﬂect the learning goals.\\n13\\n\\n\f– A good starting point are techniques that usually work well (e.g. ReLU, successful architectures). Hyperparameters (and architecture) can be tuned jointly,\\nbut “lazily” (interpolating/extrapolating from experience instead of trying too\\nmany combinations).\\n– Often it is helpful to start with a simpliﬁed dataset (e.g. fewer and/or easier\\nsamples) and a simple network, and after obtaining promising results gradually\\nincreasing the complexity of both data and network while tuning hyperparameters and trying regularization methods.\\n• Regularization via data:\\n– When not working with nearly inﬁnite/abundant data:\\n∗ Gathering more real data (and using methods that take its properties into\\naccount) is advisable if possible:\\n· Labeled samples are best, but unlabeled ones can also be helpful (compatible with semi-supervised learning).\\n· Samples from the same domain are best, but samples from similar domains can also be helpful (compatible with domain adaptation and transfer learning).\\n· Reliable high-quality samples are best, but lower-quality ones can also be\\nhelpful (their conﬁdence/importance can be adjusted accordingly).\\n· Labels for an additional task can be helpful (compatible with multi-task\\nlearning).\\n· Additional input features (from additional information sources) and/or\\ndata preprocessing (i.e. domain-speciﬁc data transformations) can be\\nhelpful (the network architecture needs to be adjusted accordingly).\\n∗ Data augmentation (e.g. target-preserving handcrafted domain-speciﬁc\\ntransformations) can well compensate for limited data. If natural ways\\nto augment data (to mimic natural transformations suﬃciently well) are\\nknown, they can be tried (and combined).\\n∗ If natural ways to augment data are unknown or turn out to be insuﬃcient,\\nit may be possible to infer the transformation from data (e.g. learning imagedeformation ﬁelds) if a suﬃcient amount of data is available for that.\\n– Popular generic methods (e.g. advanced variants of Dropout) often also help.\\n• Architecture and regularization terms:\\n– Knowledge about possible meaningful properties of the mapping can be used\\nto e.g. hardwire invariances (to certain transformations) into the architecture,\\nor be formulated as regularization terms.\\n– Popular methods may help as well (see Tables 3–4), but should be chosen to\\nmatch the assumptions about the mapping (e.g. convolutional layers are fully\\nappropriate only if local and shift-equivariant feature extraction on regular-grid\\ndata is desired).\\n• Optimization:\\n– Initialization: Even though pre-trained ready-made models greatly speed up\\nprototyping, training from a good random initialization should also be considered.\\n– Optimizers: Trying a few diﬀerent ones, including advanced ones (e.g. Nesterov\\nmomentum, Adam, ProxProp), may lead to improved results. Correctly chosen\\nparameters, such as learning rate, usually make a big diﬀerence.\\nRecommendations for developers of novel regularization methods Getting an\\noverview and understanding the reasons for the success of the best methods is a great\\nfoundation. Promising empty niches (certain combinations of taxonomy properties) exist\\nthat can be addressed. The assumptions to be imposed upon the model can have a strong\\nimpact on most elements of the taxonomy. Data augmentation is more expressive than\\nloss terms (loss terms enforce properties only in inﬁnitesimally small neighborhood of the\\ntraining samples; data augmentation can use rich transformation parameter distributions).\\n14\\n\\n\fData and loss terms impose assumptions and invariances in a rather soft manner, and\\ntheir inﬂuence can be tuned, whereas hardwiring the network architecture is a harsher way\\nto impose assumptions. Diﬀerent assumptions and options to impose them have diﬀerent\\nadvantages and disadvantages.\\nFuture directions for data-based methods There are several promising directions\\nthat in our opinion require more investigation: Adaptive sampling of θ might lead to lower\\nerrors and shorter training times (Fawzi et al., 2016) (in turn, shorter training times may\\nadditionally work as implicit regularization (Hardt et al., 2016), see also Section 7). Secondly, learning class-dependent transformations (i.e. p(θ|t)) in our opinion might lead to\\nmore plausible samples. Furthermore, the ﬁeld of adversarial examples (and network robustness to them) is gaining increased attention after the recently sparked discussion on\\nreal-world adversarial examples and their robustness/invariance to transformations such as\\nthe change of camera position (Lu et al., 2017; Athalye and Sutskever, 2017). Countering\\nstrong adversarial examples may require better regularization techniques.\\nSummary In this work we proposed a broad deﬁnition of regularization for deep learning, identiﬁed ﬁve main elements of neural network training (data, architecture, error term,\\nregularization term, optimization procedure), described regularization via each of them,\\nincluding a further, ﬁner taxonomy for each, and presented example methods from these\\nsubcategories. Instead of attempting to explain referenced works in detail, we merely pinpointed their properties relevant to our categorization. Our work demonstrates some links\\nbetween existing methods. Moreover, our systematic approach enables the discovery of new,\\nimproved regularization methods by combining the best properties of the existing ones.\\n\\nAcknowledegments\\nWe thank Antonij Golkov for valuable discussions.

Viewed from the exterior, a neural network maps inputs x to outputs y.\\nWe formulate this as y = fw (τθ (x)) for transformations τθ in input space (and similarly for hidden-feature space,\\nwhere τθ is applied in between layers of the network fw ). However, how to split this x-to-y mapping into “the τθ\\npart” and “the fw part”, and thus into Section 3 vs. Section 4, is ambiguous and up to one’s taste and goals. In\\nour choices (marked with “V” below), we attempt to use common notions and Occam’s razor.\\n• Ambiguity of attributing noise to f , or to w, or to data transformations τθ :\\n– Stochastic methods such as Stochastic depth (Huang et al., 2016b) can have several interpretations\\nif stochastic transformations are allowed for f or w:\\nV Stochastic transformation of the architecture f (randomly dropping some connections), Table 3\\nO Stochastic transformation of the weights w (setting some weights to 0 in a certain random\\npattern)\\nO Stochastic transformation τθ of data in hidden-feature space; dependence is p(θ), described in\\nTable 1 for completeness\\n• Ambiguity of splitting τθ into τ and θ:\\n– Dropout:\\nV Parameters θ are the dropout mask; dependence is p(θ); transformation τ applies the dropout\\nmask to the hidden features\\nO Parameters θ are the seed state of a pseudorandom number generator; dependence is p(θ);\\ntransformation τ internally generates the random dropout mask from the random seed and\\napplies it to the hidden features\\n– Projecting dropout noise into input space (Bouthillier et al., 2015, Sec. 3) can fit our taxonomy\\nin different ways by defining τ and θ accordingly. It can have similar interpretations as Dropout\\nabove (if τ is generalized to allow for dependence on x, f, w), but we prefer the third interpretation\\nwithout such generalizations:\\nO Parameters θ are the dropout mask (to be applied in a hidden layer); dependence is p(θ);\\ntransformation τ transforms the input to mimic the effect of the mask\\nO Parameters θ are the seed state of a pseudorandom number generator; dependence is p(θ);\\ntransformation τ internally generates the random dropout mask from the random seed and\\ntransforms the input to mimic the effect of the mask\\nV Parameters θ describe the transformation of the input in any formulation; dependence is\\np(θ|x, f, w); transformation τ merely applies the transformation in input space\\n• Ambiguity of splitting the network operation fw into layers: There are several possibilities to represent\\na function (neural network) as a composition (or directed acyclic graph) of functions (layers).\\n• Many of the input and hidden-feature transformations (Section 3) can be considered layers of the network\\n(Section 4). In fact, the term “layer” is not uncommon for Dropout or Batch normalization.\\n• The usage of a trainable parameter in several parts of the network is called weight sharing. However,\\nsome mappings can be expressed with two equivalent formulas such that a parameter appears only once\\nin one formulation, and several times in the other.\\n• Ambiguity of E vs. R: Auxiliary denoising task in ladder networks (Rasmus et al., 2015) and similar\\nautoencoder-style loss terms can be interpreted in different ways:\\nV Regularization term R without given auxiliary targets t\\nO The ideal reconstructions can be considered as targets t (if the definition of “targets” is slightly\\nmodified) and thus the denoising task becomes part of the error term E\\n\\nB\\n\\nData-augmented loss function\\n\\nTo understand the success of target-preserving data augmentation methods, we consider the data-augmented loss\\nfunction, which we obtain by replacing the training samples (xi , ti ) ∈ D in the empirical risk loss function (Eq. (3))\\nby augmented training samples (τθ (xi ), ti ):\\nL̂A =\\n\\n1\\n|D|\\n\\n1\\n=\\n|D|\\n\\nX\\n\\nh\\n\u0001i\\nEθ ℓ τθ (xi ), ti\\n\\nX\\n\\nZ \u0010\\n\u0001\u0011\\nℓ τθ (xi ), ti p(θ) dθ,\\n\\n(xi ,ti )∈D\\n\\n(xi ,ti )∈D Θ\\n\\n22\\n\\n(8)\\n\\n\fwhere we have replaced the inner part (E and R) of the loss function by ℓ to simplify the notation. Moreover, L̂A\\ncan be rewritten as\\nZZ\\nZ\\nX\\n\u0001\\n1\\nL̂A =\\nℓ(x, t) p(θ) δ x − τθ (xi ) δ(t − ti ) dθ dt dx\\n|D| (x ,t )∈D\\n=\\n\\nX,T\\n\\ni\\n\\ni\\n\\nZZ\\n\\nℓ(x, t)\\n\\n\"\\n\\n1\\n|D|\\n\\nZZ\\n\\nℓ(x, t) q(x, t) dt dx,\\n\\nX,T\\n\\n=\\n\\nΘ\\n\\nX\\n\\nZ\\n\\n(xi ,ti )∈D Θ\\n\\n#\\n\u0001\\nδ x − τθ (xi ) δ(t − ti ) p(θ) dθ dt dx\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nX,T\\n\\nR\\nwhere δ(x) is the Dirac delta function: δ(x) = 0 ∀ x =\\n6 0 and δ(x) dx = 1; and q(x, t) is defined as\\nZ\\nX\\n\u0001\\n1\\nδ x − τθ (xi ) δ(t − ti ) p(θ) dθ.\\nq(x, t) =\\n|D| (x ,t )∈D\\ni\\n\\ni\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nΘ\\n\\nRR\\nSince q is non-negative and\\nq(x, t) dx dt = 1, it is a valid probability density function inducing the distribution Q\\nof augmented data. Therefore,\\n\u0002\\n\u0003\\nL̂A = E(x,t)∼Q ℓ(x, t) .\\n(11)\\nWhen Q = P , Eq. (11) becomes the expected risk (2). We can show how this is related to importance sampling:\\n\u0002\\n\u0003\\nL = E(x,t)∼P ℓ(x, t)\\nZZ\\nℓ(x, t)p(x, t) dt dx\\n=\\nX,T\\n\\n=\\n\\nZZ\\n\\nℓ(x, t)\\n\\nX,T\\n\\np(x, t)\\nq(x, t) dt dx\\nq(x, t)\\n\\np(x, t)\\n= E(x,t)∼Q ℓ(x, t)\\nq(x, t)\\n\u0002\\n\u0003\\n6= E(x,t)∼Q ℓ(x, t)\\n\u0014\\n\\n(12)\\n\\n\u0015\\n\\n= L̂A .\\n\\nThe difference between L and L̂A is the re-weighting term p(x, t)/q(x, t) identical to the one known from importance\\nsampling (see Bishop, 1995a). The more similar Q is to P (i.e. the closer Q models the ground truth distribution\\nP ), the more similar the augmented-data loss L̂A is to the expected loss L. We see that data augmentation tries\\nto simulate the real distribution P by creating new samples from the training set D, bridging the gap between the\\nexpected and the empirical risk.\\n\\n23\\n\\n\f

Vontobel\\n\\narXiv:1508.00689v3 [cs.IT] 12 Jun 2017\\n\\nAbstract—A factor-graph representation of quantum-mechanical probabilities (involving any number of measurements) is\\nproposed. Unlike standard statistical models, the proposed representation uses auxiliary variables (state variables) that are\\nnot random variables. All joint probability distributions are\\nmarginals of some complex-valued function q, and it is demonstrated how the basic concepts of quantum mechanics relate to\\nfactorizations and marginals of q.\\nIndex Terms—Quantum mechanics, factor graphs, graphical models, marginalization, closing-the-box operation, quantum\\ncoding, tensor networks.\\n\\nI. I NTRODUCTION\\nFactor graphs [2]–[4] and similar graphical notations [5]–\\n[8] are widely used to represent statistical models with many\\nvariables. Factor graphs have become quite standard in coding\\ntheory [9], but their applications include also communications\\n[10], signal processing [11], [12], combinatorics [13], and\\nmuch more. The graphical notation can be helpful in various\\nways, including the elucidation of the model itself and the\\nderivation of algorithms for statistical inference.\\nIn this paper, we show how quantum mechanical probabilities (including, in particular, joint distributions over several\\nmeasurements) can be expressed in factor graphs that are fully\\ncompatible with factor graphs of standard statistical models\\nand error correcting codes. This is not trivial: despite being a\\nstatistical theory, quantum mechanics does not fit into standard\\nstatistical categories and it is not built on the Kolmogorov axioms of probability theory. Existing graphical representations\\nof quantum mechanics such as Feynman diagrams [14], tensor\\ndiagrams [15]–[18], and quantum circuits [19, Chap. 4] do not\\nexplicitly represent probabilities, and they are not compatible\\nwith “classical” graphical models.\\nTherefore, this paper is not just about a graphical notation,\\nbut it offers a perspective of quantum mechanics that has not\\n(as far as we know) been proposed before.\\nIn order to introduce this perspective, recall that statistical\\nmodels usually contain auxiliary variables (also called hidden\\nvariables or state variables), which are essential for factorizing the joint probability distribution. For example, a hidden\\nMarkov model with primary variables Y1 , . . . , Yn is defined\\nby a joint probability mass function of the form\\np(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xn ) = p(x0 )\\n\\nn\\nY\\n\\np(yk , xk |xk−1 ), (1)\\n\\nk=1\\n\\nH.-A.

Vontobel is with the Department of Information Engineering, The\\nChinese University of Hong Kong. Email: pascal.vontobel@ieee.org.\\nThis paper was presented in part at the 2012 IEEE Int. Symp. on Information Theory [1].\\nTo appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2017.\\n\\nwhere X0 , X1 , . . . , Xn are auxiliary variables (hidden variables) that are essential for the factorization (1). More generally, the joint distribution p(y1 , . . . , yn ) of some primary\\nvariables Y1 , . . . , Yn is structured by a factorization of the joint\\ndistribution p(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xm ) with auxiliary variables\\nX0 , . . . , Xm and\\nX\\np(y1 , . . . , yn ) =\\np(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xm ),\\n(2)\\nx0 ,...,xm\\n\\nwhere the sum is over all possible values of X0 , . . . , Xm .\\n(For the sake of exposition, we assume here that all variables\\nhave finite alphabets.) However, quantum-mechanical joint\\nprobabilities cannot, in general, be structured in this way.\\nWe now generalize p(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xm ) in (2) to an\\narbitrary complex-valued function q(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xm )\\nsuch that\\nX\\np(y1 , . . . , yn ) =\\nq(y1 , . . . , yn , x0 , . . . , xm ).\\n(3)\\nx0 ,...,xm\\n\\nThe purpose of q is still to enable a nice factorization, for\\nwhich there may now be more opportunities. Note that the\\nconcept of marginalization carries over to q; in particular,\\nall marginals of p(y1 , . . . , yn ) (involving any number of\\nvariables) are also marginals of q. However, the auxiliary\\nvariables X0 , . . . , Xm are not, in general, random variables,\\nand marginals of q involving one or several of these variables\\nare not, in general, probability distributions.\\nWe will show that this generalization allows natural representations of quantum-mechanical probabilities involving any\\nnumber of measurements. In particular, the factor graphs of\\nthis paper will represent pertinent factorizations of complexvalued functions q as in (3).\\nThis paper is not concerned with physics, but only with the\\npeculiar joint probability distributions that arise in quantum\\nmechanics. However, we will show how the basic concepts\\nand terms of quantum mechanics relate to factorizations and\\nmarginals of suitable functions q. For the sake of clarity, we\\nwill restrict ourselves to finite alphabets (with some exceptions, especially in Appendix B), but this restriction is not\\nessential. Within this limited scope, this paper may even be\\nused as a self-contained introduction to the pertinent concepts\\nof quantum mechanics.\\nTo the best of our knowlege, describing quantum probabilities (and, indeed, any probabilities) by explicitly using a\\nfunction q as in (3) is new. Nonetheless, this paper is, of\\ncourse, related to much previous work in quantum mechanics\\nand quantum computation. For example, quantum circuits as\\nin [19, Chap. 4] have natural interpretations in terms of factor\\ngraphs as will be demonstrated in Sections V-B and VIII.\\nOur factor graphs are also related to tensor diagrams [15]–\\n[18], [20], see Sections II-B and Appendix A. Also related\\n\\n\f2\\n\\nis the very recent work by Mori [21]. On the other hand,\\nquantum Bayesian networks (see, e.g., [22]) and quantum\\nbelief propagation (see, e.g., [23]) are not immediately related\\nto our approach since they are not based on (3) (and they lack\\nProposition 1 in Section II). Finally, we mention that the factor\\ngraphs of this paper are used in [24] for estimating the information rate of certain quantum channels, and iterative sumproduct message passing in such factor graphs is considered\\nin [25].\\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section II reviews factor\\ngraphs and their connection to linear algebra. In Section III,\\nwe express elementary quantum mechanics (with a single\\nprojection measurement) in factor graphs; we also demonstrate\\nhow the Schrödinger picture, the Heisenberg picture, and even\\nan elementary form of Feynman path integrals are naturally\\nexpressed in terms of factor graphs. Multiple and more general measurements are discussed in Section IV. Section V\\naddresses partial measurements, decompositions of unitary\\noperators (including quantum circuits), and the emergence of\\nnon-unitary operators from unitary interactions. In Section VI,\\nwe revisit measurements and briefly address their realization\\nin terms of unitary interactions, and in Section VII, we\\ncomment on the origin of randomness. In Section VIII, we\\nfurther illustrate the use of factor graphs by an elementary\\nintroduction to quantum coding. Section IX concludes the\\nmain part of the paper.\\nIn Appendix A, we offer some additional remarks on the\\nprior literature. In Appendix B, we briefly discuss the Wigner–\\nWeyl representation, which leads to an alternative factor-graph\\nrepresentation. In Appendix C, we outline the extension of\\nMonte Carlo methods to the factor graphs of this paper.\\nThis paper contains many figures of factor graphs that\\nrepresent some complex function q as in (3). The main figures\\nare Figs. 14, 25, 38, and 47; in a sense, the whole paper is\\nabout explaining and exploring these four figures.\\nWe will use standard linear algebra notation rather than\\nthe bra-ket notation of quantum mechanics. The Hermitian\\n4\\ntranspose of a complex matrix A will be denoted by AH = AT ,\\nT\\nwhere A is the transpose of A and A is the componentwise\\ncomplex conjugate. An identity matrix will be denoted by I.\\nThe symbol “∝” denotes equality of functions up to a scale\\nfactor.\\nII. O N FACTOR G RAPHS\\nA. Basics\\nFactor graphs represent factorizations of functions of several\\nvariables. We will use Forney factor graphs1 (also called normal factor graphs) as in [3], [4], [11], where nodes (depicted\\nas boxes) represent factors and edges represent variables. For\\nexample, assume that some function f (x1 , . . . , x5 ) can be\\nwritten as\\nf (x1 , . . . , x5 ) = f1 (x1 , x2 , x5 )f2 (x2 , x3 )f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 ). (4)\\n1 Factor graphs as in [2] represent variables not by edges, but by variable\\nnodes. Adapting Proposition 1 for such factor graphs is awkward.\\nHenceforth in this paper, “factor graph” means “Forney factor graph”; the\\nqualifier “Forney” (or “normal”) will sometimes be added to emphasize that\\nthe distinction matters.\\n\\nx5\\nf2\\n\\nx2\\n\\nf1\\n\\nx3\\n\\nf3\\n\\nx1\\n\\nx4\\n\\nFig. 1.

As in this example, variables in factor graphs are\\noften denoted by capital letters.\\nThe Forney factor-graph notation is intimately connected\\nwith the idea of opening and closing boxes [4], [11], [26].\\nConsider the dashed boxes in Fig. 3. The exterior function of\\nsuch a box is defined to be the product of all factors inside\\nthe box, summed over all its internal variables. The exterior\\nfunction of the inner dashed box in Fig. 3 is\\nX\\n4\\ng(x2 , x4 , x5 ) =\\nf2 (x2 , x3 )f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 ),\\n(5)\\nx3\\n\\nand the exterior function of the outer dashed box is\\nX\\n4\\nf (x1 , x4 ) =\\nf (x1 , . . . , x5 ).\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nx2 ,x3 ,x5\\n\\nThe summations in (5) and (6) range over all possible values\\nof the corresponding variable(s).\\nClosing a box means replacing the box with a single\\nnode that represents the exterior function of the box. For\\nexample, closing the inner dashed box in Fig. 3 replaces the\\ntwo nodes/factors f2 (x2 , x3 ) and f3 (x3 , x4 , x5 ) by the single\\nnode/factor (5); closing the outer dashed box in Fig. 3 replaces\\nall nodes/factors in (4) by the single node/factor (6); and\\n\\n\f3\\n\\np\\n\\nAB\\n\\ng\\nX\\nx\\n\\nFig. 4.

Factor-graph representation of matrix multiplication (11). The small\\ndot denotes the variable that indexes the rows of the corresponding matrix.\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\nA\\n\\nNote the equality between (7) and (6), which holds in general:\\nProposition 1. Closing an inner box within some outer box\\n(by summing over the internal variables of the inner box) does\\nnot change the exterior function of the outer box.\\n2\\nThis simple fact is the pivotal property of Forney factor\\ngraphs. Closing boxes in factor graphs is thus compatible\\nwith marginalization both of probability mass functions and\\nof complex-valued functions q as in (3), which is the basis of\\nthe present paper.\\nOpening a box in a factor graph means the reverse operation\\nof expanding a node/factor into a factor graph of its own.\\nA half edge in a factor graph is an edge that is connected\\nto only one node (such as x1 in Fig. 1). The exterior function\\nof a factor graph2 is defined to be the exterior function of\\na box that contains all nodes and all full edges, but all half\\nedges stick out (such as the outer box in Fig. 3). For example,\\nthe exterior function of Fig. 1 is (6). The partition sum3 of a\\nfactor graph is the exterior function of a box that contains the\\nwhole factor graph, including all half edges; the partition sum\\nis a constant.\\nThe exterior function of Fig. 2 is p(xn , y1 , . . . , yn ), and its\\npartition sum equals one.\\nFactor graphs can also express expectations: the partition\\nsum (and the exterior function) of Fig. 4 is\\nX\\nE[g(X)] =\\np(x)g(x),\\n(8)\\nx\\n\\nwhere p(x) is a probability mass function and g is an arbitrary\\nreal-valued (or complex-valued) function.\\nThe equality constraint function f= is defined as\\n\u001a\\n1, if x1 = · · · = xn\\nf= (x1 , . . . , xn ) =\\n(9)\\n0, otherwise.\\nThe corresponding node (which is denoted by “=”) can serve\\nas a branching point in a factor graph (cf. Figs. 21–24): only\\nconfigurations with x1 = . . . = xn contribute to the exterior\\nfunction of any boxes containing these variables.\\nA variable with a fixed known value will be marked by a\\nsolid square as in Figs. 12 and 23.\\n2 What we here call the exterior function of a factor graph, is called partition\\nfunction in [29]. The term “exterior function” was first used in [30].\\n3 What we call here the partition sum has often been called partition\\nfunction.\\n\\nz\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nFig. 6.

Factor Graphs and Matrices\\nA matrix A ∈ Cm×n may be viewed as a function\\n{1, . . . , m} × {1, . . . , n} → C : (x, y) 7→ A(x, y).\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nThe multiplication of two matrices A and B can then be\\nwritten as\\nX\\n(AB)(x, z) =\\nA(x, y)B(y, z),\\n(11)\\ny\\n\\nwhich is the exterior function of Fig. 5. Note that the identity\\nmatrix corresponds to an equality constraint function f= (x, y).\\nIn this notation, the trace of a square matrix A is\\nX\\ntr(A) =\\nA(x, x),\\n(12)\\nx\\n\\nwhich is the exterior function (and the partition sum) of the\\nfactor graph in Fig. 6 (left). Fig. 6 (right) shows the graphical\\nproof of the identity tr(AB) = tr(BA).\\nIn this way, closing and opening boxes in factor graphs may\\nthus be viewed as generalizations of matrix multiplication and\\nmatrix factorization, respectively.\\nThe factor graph of a diagonal matrix with diagonal elements from some vector v is shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 8 shows\\nthe decomposition of a Hermitian matrix A according to the\\nspectral theorem into\\nA = U ΛU H ,\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nwhere U is unitary and where Λ is diagonal and real with\\ndiagonal elements from some vector λ.\\nFactor graphs for linear algebra operations such as Fig. 5\\nand Fig. 6 (and the corresponding generalizations to tensors)\\nare essentially tensor diagrams (or trace diagrams) as in [18],\\n[27], [28]. This connection between factor graphs and tensor\\ndiagrams was noted in [29]–[31] and will further be discussed\\nin Appendix A.\\nC. Reductions\\nReasoning with factor graphs typically involves “local” manipulations of some nodes/factors (such as opening or closing\\nboxes) that preserve the exterior function of all surrounding\\nboxes. Some such reductions are shown in Figs. 9–12; these\\n(very simple) reductions will be essential for understanding the\\nproposed factor graphs for quantum-mechanical probabilities.\\n\\n\f4\\n\\nv\\n\\n..\\n.\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n..\\n.\\n\\n=\\n\\nFig. 7.

Complex Conjugate Pairs\\nA general recipe for constructing complex functions q with\\nreal and nonnegative marginals as in (3) is illustrated in\\nFig. 13, where all factors are complex valued.

For\\nfixed X = x, this dashed box turns into (all of) Fig. 15 (see\\nFig. 12). By the reductions from Figs. 10 and 11, closing\\nthe dashed box in Fig. 15 turns it into an identity matrix. It\\nfollows that the partition sum of Fig. 15 is I(x, x) = 1 (i.e.,\\nthe element in row x and column x P\\nof an identity matrix),\\nthus complying with the requirement y p(y|x) = 1.\\nIt is then clear from (17) that the partition sum of Fig. 14\\nequals 1.\\nFor fixed X = x and Y = y, the dashed box in Fig. 14\\nturns into Fig. 16, and p(y|x) is the partition sum of that\\nfactor graph. The partition sum of the upper part of Fig. 16 is\\nB(·, y)H U (·, x), where U (·, x) is column x of U and B(·, y) is\\ncolumn y of B. The partition sum of the lower part of Fig. 16\\nis U (·, x)H B(·, y).

Using Fig. 6, this partition sum can be expressed as\\n\u0001\\np(y) = tr ρB(·, y)B(·, y)H\\n(26)\\n\u0001\\nH\\n= tr B(·, y) ρB(·, y)\\n(27)\\n= B(·, y)H ρB(·, y).\\n\\n(28)\\n\\nPlugging (20) into (28) is, of course, consistent with (18).\\n\\nD. Evolution over Time: Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Feynman\\nConsider the factor graph of Fig. 21, which agrees with\\nFig. 14 except that the matrix U is expanded into the product\\nU = Un · · · U1 . One interpretation of this factor graph is\\nthat the initial state X evolves unitarily over n discrete time\\nsteps until it is measured by a projection measurement as in\\nFig. 14. Note that a continuous-time picture may be obtained,\\nif desired, by a suitable limit with n → ∞.\\nIn this setting, the so-called Schrödinger and Heisenberg\\npictures correspond to sequentially closing boxes (from the\\ninnermost dashed box to the outermost dashed box) as in\\nFigs. 22 and 24, respectively; the former propagates the\\nquantum state ψ (or the density matrix ρ) forward in time\\nwhile the latter propagates the measurement backwards in\\ntime. The resulting probability distribution over Y is identical\\nby Proposition 1.\\nBoth the Schrödinger picture and the Heisenberg picture\\ncan be reduced to sum-product message passing in a cyclefree graph as follows. In the Schrödinger picture, assume first\\nthat the initial state X is known. In this case, we obtain the\\ncycle-free factor graph of Fig. 23, in which p(y|x) is easily\\ncomputed by left-to-right sum-product message passing (cf.\\n[2], [4]), which amounts to a sequence of matrix-times-vector\\nmultiplications\\nψk = Uk ψk−1\\n(31)\\n4\\n\\nwith ψ1 = U1 (·, x) (= column x of U1 ). The quantities\\nψ1 , . . . , ψn in Fig. 23 are the wave functions propagated up to\\nthe corresponding time. Since Fig. 23 consists of two complex\\nconjugate parts, it suffices to carry out these computations for\\none of the two parts.\\nIf the initial state X is not known, we write\\nX\\np(y) =\\np(x)p(y|x),\\n(32)\\nx\\n\\nand each term p(y|x) can be computed as in Fig. 23. This\\ndecomposition carries over to the relation\\nX\\nρk (x0 , x00 ) =\\np(x)ψk (x0 )ψkH (x00 )\\n(33)\\nx\\n\\nC. Observables\\nIn most standard formulations of quantum mechanics, the\\noutcome of a physical experiment is not Y as in Fig. 14, but\\nsome (essentially arbitrary) real-valued function g(Y ).\\nIn Fig. 19, we have augmented Fig. 14 by a corresponding\\nfactor g(Y ). The partition sum of Fig. 19 is thus\\nX\\nE[g(Y )] =\\np(y)g(y),\\n(29)\\ny\\n\\ncf. Fig. 4. Regrouping Fig. 19 as in Fig. 18 yields Fig. 20, the\\npartition sum of which is\\nE[g(Y )] = tr(ρO) ,\\n\\n(30)\\n\\nwhere the matrix O is the right-hand dashed box in Fig. 18.\\nNote that, by the spectral theorem, every Hermitian matrix O can be represented as in Fig. 20 (cf. Fig. 8) and\\ng(1), . . . , g(M ) are the eigenvalues of O.\\nIn this paper, however, we will focus on probabilities and\\nwe will not further use such expectations.\\n\\n=\\n\\nX\\n\\np(x)ψk (x0 )ψk (x00 )\\n\\n(34)\\n\\nx\\n\\nbetween the wave function ψk and the density matrix ρk (see\\nFigs. 22 and 23) for k = 1, . . . , n.\\nIn the Heisenberg picture (Fig. 24), we can proceed analogously. For any fixed Y = y, this value can be plugged into the\\nfactors/matrices B and B H , which turns Fig. 24 into a cyclefree factor graph that looks almost like a time-reversed version\\nof Fig. 23. In consequence, p(y) can be computed by rightto-left sum-product message passing, which again amounts to\\na sequence of matrix-times-vector multiplications.\\nFinally, we note that the dashed boxes in Fig. 21 encode\\nFeynman’s path integral in its most elementary embodiment.\\nEach internal configuration (i.e., an assignment of values to\\nall variables) in such a box may be viewed as a “path”, and\\nthe corresponding product of all factors inside the box may\\nbe viewed as the (complex) weight of the path. The exterior\\nfunction of the box is (by definition) the sum, over all internal\\nconfigurations/paths, of the weight of each configuration/path.\\n\\n\f7\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\nU1\\n\\nX\\n\\nr\\n\\n...\\n\\nU2\\n\\nr\\n\\nUn\\n\\nBH\\n\\n=\\n\\np(x)\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\nU1H\\n\\nU2H\\n\\n...\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\nUnH\\n\\nB\\n\\n=\\n\\nY\\n\\nFig. 21.

M ULTIPLE AND M ORE G ENERAL M EASUREMENTS\\nWe now turn to multiple and more general measurements.\\nConsider the factor graph of Fig. 25. In this figure, U0 and U1\\nare M × M unitary matrices, and all variables except Y1 and\\nY2 take values in the set {1, . . . , M }. The two large boxes in\\nthe figure represent measurements, as will be detailed below.\\nThe factor/box p(x0 ) is a probability mass function over the\\ninitial state X0 . We will see that this factor graph (with suitable\\nmodeling of the measurements) represents the joint probability\\nmass function p(y1 , y2 ) of a general M -dimensional quantum\\nsystem with two observations Y1 and Y2 . The generalization\\nto more observed variables Y1 , Y2 , . . . is obvious.\\nThe unitary matrix U0 in Fig. 25 represents the development\\nof the system between the initial state and the first measurement according to the Schrödinger equation; the unitary\\nmatrix U1 in Fig. 25 represents the development of the system\\nbetween the two measurements.\\nIn the most basic case, the initial state X0 = x0 is known\\nand the measurements look as shown in Fig. 26, where the\\nmatrices B1 and B2 are also unitary (cf. Fig. 14). In this case,\\nthe observed variables Y1 and Y2 take values in {1, . . . , M }\\nas well. Note that the lower part of this factor graph is\\nthe complex-conjugate mirror image of the upper part (as in\\nFig. 13).\\nIn quantum-mechanical terms, measurements as in\\nFig. 26 are projection measurements with one-dimensional\\neigenspaces (as in Section III).\\nA very general form of measurement is shown in Fig. 29.\\nIn this case, the range of Yk is a finite set Yk , and for each\\nyk ∈ Yk , the factor Ak (x̃k , xk , yk ) corresponds to a complex\\nsquare matrix Ak (yk ) (with row index x̃k and column index\\nxk ) such that\\nX\\nAk (yk )H Ak (yk ) = I,\\n(35)\\nyk ∈Jk\\n\\ncf. [19, Chap. 2]. A factor-graphic interpretation of (35)\\nis given in Fig. 30. Condition (35) is both necessary and\\nsufficient for Proposition 2 (below) to hold. Measurements as\\nin Fig. 26 are included as a special case with Yk = {1, . . . , M }\\nand\\nAk (yk ) = Ak (yk )H = Bk (·, yk )Bk (·, yk )H ,\\n(36)\\nwhere Bk (·, yk ) denotes the yk -th column of Bk . Note that,\\nfor fixed yk , (36) is a projection matrix.\\nMeasurements will further be discussed in sections V-A\\nand VI.\\nIt is clear from Section II-D that the exterior function of\\nFig. 25 (with measurements as in Fig. 26 or as in Fig. 29)\\nis real and nonnegative. We now proceed to analyze these\\nfactor graphs and to verify that they yield the correct quantummechanical probabilities p(y1 , y2 ) for the respective class of\\nmeasurements. To this end, we need to understand the exterior\\nfunctions of the dashed boxes in Fig. 27. We begin with the\\ndashed box on the right-hand side of Fig. 27.\\nProposition 2 (Don’t Mind the Future). Closing the dashed\\nbox on the right-hand side in Fig. 27 (with a measurement as\\nin Fig. 26 or as in Fig. 29, but with unknown result Y2 of the\\nmeasurement) reduces it to an equality constraint function. 2\\n\\nProof: For measurements as in Fig. 26, the proof amounts\\nto a sequence of reductions according to Figs. 10 and 11, as\\nillustrated in Fig. 31.\\nFor measurements as in Fig. 29, the key step is the reduction\\nof Fig. 30 to an equality constraint, which is equivalent to the\\ncondition (35).\\n\u0004\\nProposition 2 guarantees, in particular, that a future measurement (with unknown result) does not influence present or\\npast observations. The proposition clearly holds also for the\\nextension of Fig. 25 to any finite number of measurements\\nY1 , Y2 , . . . and can then be applied recursively from right to\\nleft.\\nWe pause here for a moment to emphasize this point: it is\\nobvious from Figs. 25 and 26 (generalized to n measurements\\nY1 , . . . , Yn ) that, in general, a measurement resulting in some\\nvariable Yk affects the joint distribution of all other variables\\nY1 , . . . , Yk−1 , Yk+1 , . . . , Yn (both past and future) even if the\\nresult Yk of the measurement is not known. By Proposition 2,\\nhowever, the joint distribution of Y1 , . . . , Yk−1 is not affected\\nby the measurement of Yk , . . . , Yn provided that no measurement results are known.\\nProposition 3 (Proper Normalization). The factor graph of\\nFig. 25 (with measurements as in Fig. 26 or as in Fig. 29)\\nrepresents a properly normalized probability mass function,\\ni.e.,\\nP the exterior function p(y1 , y2 ) is real and nonnegative and\\n2\\ny1 ,y2 p(y1 , y2 ) = 1.\\nIn particular, the partition sum of Fig. 25 equals 1. Again, the\\nproposition clearly holds also for the extension of Fig. 25 to\\nany finite number of measurements Y1 , Y2 , . . .\\nProof of Proposition 3: Apply reductions according to\\nProposition 2 recursively\\nP from right to left in Fig. 25, followed\\nby the final reduction x0 p(x0 ) = 1.\\n\u0004\\nConsider now the dashed boxes on the left in Figs. 27\\nand 28, which correspond to the density matrix before and\\nafter measuring Y1 , respectively. A density matrix ρ is defined\\nto be properly normalized if\\ntr(ρ) = 1.\\n\\n(37)\\n\\nThe dashed box left in Fig. 27 is properly normalized\\n(tr(ρ1 ) = 1) by (25). Proper normalization of ρk for k > 1\\nfollows from Propositions 5–7 below.\\nConsider next the dashed box in Fig. 28, which we will call\\nρ̆1 ; it is not a properly normalized density matrix:\\nProposition 4 (Trace of the Past).\\ntr(ρ̆1 ) = p(y1 );\\n\\n(38)\\n\\nmore generally, with k measurements Y1 = y1 , . . . , Yk = yk\\ninside the dashed box, we have\\ntr(ρ̆k ) = p(y1 , . . . , yk ).\\n\\n(39)\\n2\\n\\nThe proof is immediate from Propositions 2 and 3 (generalized to an arbitrary number of measurements).

Note that the partition sum of Fig. 32 is\\ntr(ρk ) = 1 (cf.

From Fig. 30, we see that\\nthe partition sum of Fig. 35 is tr(ρk ) = 1, which means that\\nthe exterior function of Fig. 35 equals p(yk |yk−1 , . . . , y1 ), i.e.,\\nthe missing scale factor in (54) has been compensated by the\\nnormalization of ρk .\\nFor fixed Yk = yk , (52) is then obvious from Fig. 36.\\nConcerning the post-measurement density matrix ρ̃k , for a\\nmeasurement Yk = yk as in Fig. 29, the dashed box in Fig. 28\\nlooks as in Fig. 37. The numerator of (53) is then obvious\\nfrom Fig. 37, and the denominator of (53) is simply the proper\\nnormalization (37).\\n\u0004\\nIn summary, Propositions 2–7 verify that the factor graph\\nof Fig. 25 (with measurements as in Fig. 26 or as in Fig. 29)\\nyields the correct quantum-mechanical probabilities for the\\nrespective class of measurements.\\nV. D ECOMPOSITIONS AND Q UANTUM C IRCUITS , AND\\nN ON -U NITARY O PERATORS FROM U NITARY\\nI NTERACTIONS\\nFigs. 25 and 29, while fully general, do not do justice to the\\nrichness of quantum-mechanical probabilities and their factorgraph representation, which we are now going to address.\\nA. Decompositions and Partial Measurements\\nConsider the factor graph of Fig. 38. The following points\\nare noteworthy. First, we note that the unitary matrices U0 , U1 ,\\nU2 in Fig. 38 have more than two incident edges. This is to be\\nunderstood as illustrated in Fig. 39, where the rows of some\\n\\nmatrix are indexed by X while its columns are indexed by\\nthe pair (V, W ). More generally, rows (marked by a dot) and\\ncolumns may both be indexed by several variables. Note that,\\nin this way, bundling two unconnected matrices as in Fig. 40\\nrepresents the tensor product A ⊗ B. In Fig. 38, all matrices\\nare square, which implies that the product of the alphabet sizes\\nof the row-indexing variables must equal the product of the\\nalphabet sizes of the column-indexing variables.\\nSecond, each edge in the factor graph of Fig. 38 may\\nactually represent several (finite-alphabet) variables, bundled\\ninto a single compound variable.\\nThird, each of the unitary matrices U0 , U1 , U2 , . . . may itself\\nbe a product, either of smaller unitary matrices as illustrated in\\nFig. 41, or of more general factors as exemplified by Fig. 45;\\nsee also Section V-B below.\\nForth, it is obvious from Fig. 38 that each measurement\\ninvolves only some of the variables while some other variables\\nare left alone. The actual measurements shown in Fig. 38 are as\\nin Fig. 26 (with unitary matrices B1 , B2 . . .), but more general\\nmeasurements could be used.\\nThe measurements in Fig. 38 (including the uninvolved\\nvariables) are indeed a special case of measurements as in\\nFig. 29, as is obvious from Fig. 42, from where we may\\nalso read Ak (yk ) = I ⊗ (Bk (yk )Bk (yk )H ). In order to verify\\n(35), we first recall its factor-graphic interpretation in Fig. 30,\\nwhich, in this case, amounts to the obvious reduction of Fig. 43\\nto an equality constraint.\\nB. Quantum Circuits\\nQuantum gates [19, Chap. 4] are unitary matrices used in\\nquantum computation. (In Figs. 25 or 38, such quantum gates\\nwould appear as, or inside, U0 , U1 , U2 , . . . ) For example,\\nFig. 44 shows a swap gate and Fig. 45 shows a controlledNOT gate in factor-graph notation. All variables in these two\\nexamples are {0, 1}-valued (rather than {1, 2}-valued), both\\nrows and columns are indexed by pairs of bits (cf. Fig. 39),\\nand the factor f⊕ in Fig. 45 is defined as\\nf⊕ : {0, 1}3 → {0, 1} :\\n\u001a\\n1, if ξ1 + ξ2 + ξ3 is even\\n4\\nf⊕ (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) =\\n0, otherwise.\\n\\n(55)\\n\\n\f13\\n\\nV\\nX\\n\\nr\\n\\nf=\\nXk,1\\n\\nW\\n\\nBkH\\n\\nXk,2\\n\\nBk\\nr\\n\\nFig. 39.

(However, this upper half cannot, by itself,\\nproperly represent the joint probability distribution of several\\nmeasurements.)\\n\\nX\\nr\\nξ\\np(ξ)\\n\\ny\\n\\n(corresponding to (35) and Fig. 30), can be represented as\\na marginalized unitary interaction as in Fig. 47, cf. [19,\\nBox 8.1]).\\nIt seems natural to conjecture that classicality emerges out\\nof such marginalized unitary interactions, as has been proposed\\nby Zurek [33], [34] and others.\\nFinally, we mention some standard terminology associated\\nwith Fig. 48. For fixed Y = y, E(y) is a matrix, and these\\nmatrices in Fig. 48 are called Kraus operators (cf. the operatorsum representation in [19, Sec. 8.2.3]). The exterior function\\nof the dashed box in Fig. 48, when viewed as a matrix with\\nrows indexed by (X̃, X̃ 0 ) and columns indexed by (X, X 0 ), is\\ncalled Liouville superoperator; when viewed as a matrix with\\nrows indexed by (X, X̃) and columns indexed by (X 0 , X̃ 0 ), it\\nis called Choi matrix (see, e.g., [18]).\\nVI. M EASUREMENTS R ECONSIDERED\\nOur tour through quantum-mechanical concepts followed\\nthe traditional route where “measurement” is an unexplained\\nprimitive. However, based on the mentioned correspondence\\nbetween Fig. 48 and Fig. 47, progress has been made in\\nunderstanding measurement as interaction [35], [36].\\nThere thus emerges a view of quantum mechanics fundamentally involving only unitary transforms and marginalization. This view is still imperfectly developed (cf. [36]), but\\nthe basic idea can be explained quite easily.\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\nr\\n\\nC. Non-unitary Operators from Unitary Interactions\\nUp to now, we have considered systems composed from\\nonly two elements: unitary evolution and measurement. (The\\nrole and meaning of the latter continues to be debated, see also\\nSection VI.) However, a natural additional element is shown\\nin Fig. 47, where a primary quantum system interacts once\\nwith a secondary quantum system.\\n(The secondary quantum system might be a stray particle\\nthat arrives from “somewhere”, interacts with the primary\\nsystem, and travels off to somewhere else. Or, with exchanged\\nroles, the secondary system might be a measurement apparatus\\nthat interacts once with a particle of interest.)\\nClosing the dashed box in Fig. 47 does not, in general,\\nresult in a unitary operator. Clearly, the exterior function of\\nthe dashed box in Fig. 47 can be represented as in Fig. 48,\\nwhich may be viewed as a measurement as in Fig. 29 with\\nunknown result Y .

Projection Measurements\\nThe realization of a projection measurement by a unitary\\ninteraction is exemplified in Fig. 49. As will be detailed below,\\nFig. 49 (left) is a unitary interaction as in Fig. 47 while Fig. 49\\n(right) is a projection measurement (with unknown result ζ).\\nWe will see that the exterior functions of Fig. 49 (left) and\\nFig. 49 (right) are equal.\\nAll variables in Fig. 49 (left) take values in the set\\n{0, . . . , M −1} (rather than in {1, . . . , M }) and the box labeled “⊕” generalizes (55) to\\nf⊕ : {0, . . . , M −1}3 → {0, 1} :\\n\u001a\\n1, if (ξ1 + ξ2 + ξ3 ) mod M = 0\\n4\\nf⊕ (ξ1 , ξ2 , ξ3 ) =\\n(57)\\n0, otherwise.\\nWe first note that the two inner dashed boxes in Fig. 49\\n(left) are unitary matrices, as is easily verified from Fig. 46.\\nTherefore, Fig. 49 (left) is indeed a special case of Fig. 47.\\nThe key step in the reduction of Fig. 49 (left) to Fig. 49\\n(right) is shown in Fig. 50, which in turn can be verified as\\nfollows: the product of the two factors in the box in Fig. 50\\n(left) is zero unless both\\nξ + ζ + ξ˜ = 0\\n\\nmod M\\n\\n(58)\\n\\nξ + ζ 0 + ξ˜ = 0\\n\\nmod M,\\n\\n(59)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\f15\\n\\nX\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\n=\\n\\nr\\n\\nB\\n\\nr\\n\\nX̃\\n\\nB\\n\\nBH\\n\\n=\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\n=\\n\\nζ\\n\\n=\\n\\np(ξ)\\n\\nr\\n\\nr\\n\\n⊕\\n\\nX0\\n\\nX\\n\\nB\\n\\nBH\\n\\nξ\\n\\nX̃\\n\\nr\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n⊕\\n\\nζ0\\nBH\\nr\\n\\n=\\n\\nX̃ 0\\n\\nX0\\n\\nr\\n\\nB\\n=\\n\\nBH\\nr\\n\\nX̃ 0\\n\\nFig. 49.

(In fact, this property characterizes projection measurements.) Therefore, the random variable ζ is an objective property of the quantum system after the measurement/interaction; it can be cloned, and it can, in principle,\\nbe observed, either directly or via some “channel” p(y|ζ),\\nas illustrated in Fig. 51. The conditional-probability factor\\np(y|ζ) allows, in particular, that ζ is not fully observable,\\ni.e., different values of ζ may lead to the same observation\\nY = y.\\n\\nX̃ 0\\n\\nA very general form of (indirect) measurement is shown in\\nFig. 52, which is identical to Fig. 47 except for the observable\\nvariable Y . The figure is meant to be interpreted as follows.\\nSome primary quantum system (with variables X, X 0 , X̃, X̃ 0 )\\ninteracts once with a secondary quantum system, which in\\nturn is measured by a projection measurement as in Fig. 51.\\nIt is not difficult to verify (e.g., by adapting the procedure in\\n[19, Box 8.1]) that an interaction as in Fig. 52 can realize any\\nmeasurement as in Fig. 29.\\nVII.

In this case, (ξ, ξ 0 ) can\\nbe marginalized away by closing the dashed box in Fig. 53,\\nwhich amounts to forming the \u0001density matrix ρ(x, x0 ) as a\\npartial trace of ρ (x, ξ), (x0 , ξ 0 ) . In this reduced model, ξ\\nis a random variable (inside the representation of the density\\nmatrix ρ(x, x0 )), as is obvious in Fig. 53).\\nIn other words, random variables are created as a byproduct\\nof separation: if a quantum system splits into two parts that\\ndo not interact in the future, then focussing on one subsystem\\n(by marginalizating the other subsystem away) turns the state\\nvariable(s) of the other subsystem into random variables.\\nThe number of random variables that can be created in this\\nway is limited by the initial state: the product of the alphabet\\nsizes of X and ξ must equal the alphabet size of X0 in Fig. 53.\\nIn particular, a stochastic process ξ1 , ξ2 , . . . , cannot be\\ncreated in this way (i.e., without measurements or additional\\nquantum variables) if the alphabet of X0 is finite.\\nIf we drop the restriction to finite alphabets, then stochastic\\nprocesses are possible.

The encoder of a quantum code maps some given\\n(classical or quantum) information into a quantum system with\\nstate variables (X1 , X10 ), . . . , (Xn , Xn0 ), which is fed as input\\nto the quantum channel. The output of the quantum channel\\nis processed by the detector, which involves measurements\\nwith results Y1 , . . . , Ym . From these results, the reconstruction\\ndevice attempts to recover either the pre-channel quantum state\\nor the (classical or quantum) information that was encoded.\\nFig. 55 shows the factor graph of such a system. More\\nprecisely, the figure shows the factor graph of a general\\ncode with density matrix ρcode , a memoryless channel, and\\na general detector. A channel is called memoryless if it\\noperates separately on X1 , X2 , . . ., as shown in Fig. 55. The\\nreconstruction device is not shown in Fig. 55.\\nIn the special case where the code and the detector can be\\nrepresented as in Fig. 56, the quantum channel is effectively\\ntransformed into a classical memoryless channel with m = n\\nand\\nn\\nY\\np(y1 , . . . , yn | x̆1 , . . . , x̆n ) =\\np(y` | x̆` ),\\n(62)\\n`=1\\n\\n(61)\\n\\nas illustrated in Fig. 54.

O N Q UANTUM C ODES AND C HANNELS\\nIn this final section, we briefly outline the basic concepts\\nof quantum coding [19] in terms of the factor-graph representation.\\nA quantum channel is an operator that maps a density matrix\\ninto another density matrix, as will be discussed below. The\\npurpose of quantum coding is to create an overall quantum\\nsystem, around the channel, that is insensitive (within some\\nlimits) to the action of the channel.\\n\\nand ρcode effectively reduces to the indicator function\\n\u001a\\n1, (x̆1 , . . . , x̆n ) ∈ C\\n4\\nIC (x̆1 , . . . , x̆n ) =\\n0, otherwise\\n\\n(63)\\n\\nof a classical code C (up to a scale factor). In this case, standard classical decoding algorithms can be used. For example,\\nif C is a low-density parity-check code, it can be decoded by\\niterative sum-product message passing in the factor graph of\\nC [4], [9] .\\nBy contrast, in genuine quantum coding, the detector does\\nnot split as in Fig. 56.\\nA. On Channels\\nA factor graph of a quite general class of memoryless\\nchannel models is shown in Fig. 57, which may be interpreted\\n\\n\f18\\n\\nχ\\n\\nThe matrices σ0 , . . . , σ3 are unitary and Hermitian, and they\\nform a basis of C2×2 .\\n\\nA` (ξ` )\\nr\\n\\nX`\\nξ`\\n\\nX̃`\\n\\n=\\n\\np(ξ` )\\nX`0\\n\\nX̃`0\\n\\nr\\nA` (ξ` )H\\n\\nFig. 57.

Simplified version of Fig. 57 for fixed ξ` .\\n\\nin several different ways. For example, the matrix A` (ξ` )\\nmight be an unknown unitary matrix that is selected by the\\nrandom variable ξ` with probability density function p(ξ` ). Or,\\nin an other interpretation, Fig. 57 without the node/factor p(ξ` )\\nis a general operation as in Fig. 48.\\nMany quantum coding schemes distinguish only between\\n“no error” in position ` (i.e., A` (ξ` ) = I) and “perhaps\\nsome error” (where A` (ξ` ) is arbitrary, but nonzero); no other\\ndistinction is made and no prior p(ξ` ) is assumed. For the\\nanalysis of such schemes, Fig. 57 can often be replaced by\\nthe simpler Fig. 58. In such an analysis, it may be helpful\\nto express the (fixed, but unknown) matrix A` in Fig. 58 in\\nsome pertinent basis. For example, any matrix A ∈ C2×2 can\\nbe written as\\n3\\nX\\nA=\\nw k σk\\n(64)\\nk=0\\n\\nwith w0 , . . . , w3 ∈ C and where σ0 , . . . , σ3 are the Pauli\\nmatrices\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\n1 0\\n4\\nσ0 =\\n,\\n(65)\\n0 1\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\n0 1\\n4\\nσ1 =\\n,\\n(66)\\n1 0\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\n0 −i\\n4\\nσ2 =\\n,\\n(67)\\ni 0\\nand\\n4\\n\\nσ3 =\\n\\n\u0012\\n\\n1\\n0\\n\\n0\\n−1\\n\\n\u0013\\n.\\n\\n(68)\\n\\nB. Repetition Codes of Length 2 and 3\\nFig. 59 (left) shows the factor graph of an encoder of a\\nsimple code of length n = 3. All variables in this factor graph\\nare binary, and the initial density matrix ρ0 is arbitrary. Note\\nthat this encoder can be realized with two controlled-not gates\\n(cf. Fig. 45) and two ancillary qubits with fixed initial state\\nzero.\\nA detector for this code is shown in Fig. 59 (right). This\\ndetector can be realized with two controlled-not gates and two\\nqubit measurements. The unitary part of this detector inverts\\nthe unitary part of the encoder, and the measured bits Y1\\nand Y2 (henceforth called syndrome bits) correspond to the\\nancillary qubits in the encoder.\\nThe code of Fig. 59 is not very useful in itself, but it suffices\\nto demonstrate some basic ideas of quantum coding and it\\nfurther illustrates the use of factor graphs. Moreover, once this\\nsimple code is understood, it is easy to proceed to the Shor\\ncode [19], which can correct an arbitrary single-qubit error.\\nThe encoder-detector pair of Fig. 59 may be viewed as\\ntwo nested encoder-detector pairs for a repetition code of\\nlength n = 2: the inner encoder-detector pair produces the\\nsyndrome bit Y2 , and the outer encoder-detector pair produces\\nthe syndrome bit Y1 .\\nTherefore, we now consider the net effect of the encoder,\\nthe channel, and the detector of a repetition code of length\\nn = 2 as shown in Figs. 60 and 61. We assume that at most\\none qubit error occurs, either in the direct path (as in Fig. 60)\\nor in the check path (as in Fig. 61). This single potential error\\nis a general nonzero matrix A ∈ C2×2 (as in Fig. 58) with\\nrow and column indices in {0, 1}.\\nFor fixed Y = y, the net effect of the encoder, the channel,\\nand the detector amounts to a matrix A= (y) or A⊕ (y) corresponding to the dashed boxes in Figs. 60 and 61, respectively.\\nIf A = I (i.e., if there is no error), we necessarily have\\nY = 0 and A= (0) = A⊕ (0) = I.

We assume that\\nat most one qubit error occurs, or, equivalently, A` = I except\\nfor a single index ` ∈ {1, 2, 3}. For the inner encoder-detector\\npair, the above analysis of Figs. 60 and 61 applies immediately.\\nFor the outer encoder-detector pair, the same analysis can be\\nreused, with the error matrix A replaced by A= (y2 ) or A⊕ (y2 )\\nfrom the inner code. The resulting effective channel from the\\nencoder input to the detector output in Fig. 59, as a function\\nof Y1 and Y2 , is tabulated in Table I.\\nFrom Table I, we observe that the syndrome bits Y1 and\\nY2 uniquely determine the resulting effective channel, which\\nallows us to compress Table I into Table II. Note that the four\\nunknown parameters w0 , w1 , w2 , w3 of the error matrix (64)\\nare thus converted into only two unknown parameters (either\\nw0 and w3 or w1 and w2 , depending on Y1 , Y2 ).\\nIn the special case where we consider only bit flips, i.e., if\\nwe assume w2 = w3 = 0, then it is obvious from Table II\\nthat the code of Fig. 59 can correct a single bit flip in any\\nposition.

The\\nfigure shows only the upper half of the factor graph (i.e.,\\nthe quantum circuit).

Note that this encoder uses four copies of\\nthe encoder in Fig. 59: three independent inner encoders are\\nglued together with an outer encoder.\\nAs a detector, we use the obvious generalization of Fig. 59\\n(right), i.e., the mirror image of the encoder.\\nThis encoder-detector pair is easily analyzed using the\\nresults of Section VIII-B. For this analysis, we assume that at\\nmost a single qubit error occurs (i.e., A` 6= I for at most one\\nindex ` ∈ {1, . . . , 9}). In consequence, two of the three inner\\nencoder-detector pairs are error-free and reduce to an identity\\nmatrix. The remaining inner encoder-detector pair is described\\nby Table II. The multiplication by H both in the encoder and\\nin the detector changes Table II to Table III. Note that the\\nresulting effective channel is either of the form aσ0 + bσ1 or\\ncσ2 + dσ3 , and the detector knows which case applies.\\nThe outer encoder-detector pair thus sees an error in at\\nmost one position, and the potential error is described by\\nTable II, except that the underlying channel is not (64), but as\\nin Table III. Revisiting Table II accordingly yields Table IV,\\nwhich describes the net effect of the outer encoder-detector\\npair. In any case, the resulting effective channel is of the\\nform ασk for some nonzero α ∈ C and some (known)\\n\\nIX. C ONCLUSION\\nWe have proposed factor graphs for quantum-mechanical\\nprobabilities involving any number of measurements, both for\\nbasic projection measurements and for general measurements.\\nOur factor graphs represent factorizations of complex-valued\\nfunctions q as in (3) such that the joint probability distribution\\nof all random variables (in a given quantum system) is a\\nmarginal of q. Therefore (and in contrast to other graphical\\nrepresentations of quantum mechanics), our factor graphs are\\nfully compatible with standard statistical models. We have also\\ninterpreted a variety of concepts and quantities of quantum\\nmechanics in terms of factorizations and marginals of such\\nfunctions q. We have further illustrated the use of factor graphs\\nby an elementary introduction to quantum coding.\\nIn Appendix A, we offer some additional remarks on the\\nprior literature. In Appendix B, we derive factor graphs for\\nthe Wigner–Weyl representation. In Appendix C, we point out\\nthat the factor graphs of this paper are amenable (at least in\\nprinciple) to Monte Carlo algorithms.\\nWe hope that our approach makes quantum-mechanical\\nprobabilities more accessible to non-physicists and further\\npromotes the exchange of concepts and algorithms between\\nphysics, statistical inference, and error correcting codes in the\\nspirit of [5], [26], [37].\\nFinally, we mention that the factor graphs of this paper have\\nbeen used in [24] for estimating the information rate of certain\\nquantum channels, and iterative sum-product message passing\\nin such factor graphs is considered in [25].\\n\\n\f21\\n\\v\\nH\\nHH\\n\\nHH\\nw H\\\\n\\nFig. 63.

Tensor Networks\\nWith hindsight, the factor graphs of this paper are quite\\nsimilar to tensor networks [16]–[18], [20], which have recently\\nmoved into the heart of theoretical physics [37].\\nTensor networks (and related graphical notation) have been\\nused to represent the wave function |Ψi of several entangled\\nspins at a given time. In general, the resulting states are called\\ntensor network states (TNS), but depending on the structure\\nof the tensor network, more specialized names like matrix\\nproduct states (MPS), tree tensor states (TTS), etc., are used.\\nA very nice overview of this line of work is given in the\\nsurvey paper by Cirac and Verstraete [16], which also explains\\nthe connection of TNS to techniques like the density matrix\\nrenormalization group (DMRG), the multiscale entanglement\\nrenormalization ansatz (MERA), and projected entangled pair\\nstates (PEPS).\\nIf such tensor diagrams are used to represent quantities like\\nhΨ|Ψi or hΨ|σ2 σ4 |Ψi (see, e.g., Fig. 2 in [16]), they have\\ntwo conjugate parts, like the factor graphs in the present paper\\n(Fig. 13, etc.).\\nIt should be noted, however, that the graphical conventions\\nof tensor networks differ from factor graphs in this point: the\\nmeaning of a tensor network diagram frequently depends on\\nits orientation on the page (see, e.g., [18]), and exchanging left\\nand right amounts to a Hermitian transposition, as illustrated\\nin Fig. 63.\\nB. Quantum Bayesian Networks and Quantum Belief Propagation\\nWhereas the present paper uses conventional Forney factor graphs (with standard semantics and algorithms), various\\nauthors have proposed modified graphical models or specific\\n“quantum algorithms” for quantum mechanical quantities [22],\\n[38], [39]. Such graphical models (or algorithms) are not\\ncompatible with standard statistical models; they are not based\\non (3) and they lack Proposition 1.\\nC. Keldysh Formalism\\nThere are some high-level similarities between the graphical\\nmodels in the present paper and some diagrams that appear\\nin the context of the Keldysh formalism (see, e.g., [40]); in\\nparticular, both have “two branches along the time axis.”\\nHowever, there are also substantial dissimilarities: first,\\nthe diagrams in the Keldysh formalism also have a third\\nbranch along the imaginary axis; second, our factor graphs\\nare arguably more explicit than the diagrams in the Keldysh\\nformalism.\\n\\nD. Normal Factor Graphs, Classical Analytical Mechanics,\\nand Feynman Path Integrals\\nIn [41], it is shown how Forney factor graphs (= normal factor graphs) can be used for computations in classical analytical\\nmechanics. In particular, it is shown how to represent the\\naction S(x) of a trajectory x and how to use the stationary-sum\\nalgorithm for finding the path where the action is stationary.\\nIt is straightforward to modify the factor graphs in [41] in\\norder to compute, at\u0001 least in principle, Feynman path integrals,\\nwhere exp ~i S(x) is integrated over a suitable domain of\\npaths x: essentially by\\n\u0001 replacing the function nodes f ( · )\\nin [41] by exp ~i f ( · ) , and by replacing the stationary-sum\\nalgorithm by standard sum-product message passing [4].\\nA PPENDIX B\\nW IGNER –W EYL R EPRESENTATION\\nThe Wigner–Weyl representation of quantum mechanics\\nexpresses the latter in terms of the “phase-space” coordinates\\nq and p (corresponding to the position and the momentum,\\nrespectively, of classical mechanics). When transformed into\\nthis representation, the density matrix turns into a real-valued\\nfunction.\\nSo far in this paper, all variables were assumed to take\\nvalues in some finite set without any structure. However, the\\nWigner–Weyl representation requires that both the original\\ncoordinates X and X 0 and the new coordinates p and q\\ncan be added and subtracted and admit a Fourier transform\\nas in (81) and (85) below. In the following, we assume\\nXk , Xk0 , pk , qk ∈ RN for all k.\\nIn a factor graph with continuous variables, the exterior\\nfunction of a box is defined by integrating over the internal\\nvariables, i.e., the sum in (5) and (6) is replaced by an integral.\\nMoreover, the equality constraint function (9) becomes\\nf= (x1 , . . . , xn ) = δ(x1 − x2 ) · · · δ(xn−1 − xn ),\\n\\n(78)\\n\\nwhere δ is the Dirac delta. Finally, matrices (cf. Section II-B)\\nare generalized to operators, i.e., the sums in (11) and (12)\\nare replaced by integrals.\\nThe transformation to the Wigner–Weyl representation uses\\nan operator W that will be described below. Factor graphs for\\nthe Wigner–Weyl representation may then be obtained from\\nthe factor graphs in Sections III–V by a transformation as in\\nFig. 64. The example in this figure is a factor graph as in\\nFig. 25 with a single measurement, but the generalization to\\nany number of measurements is obvious. Starting from the\\noriginal factor graph (top in Fig. 64), we first insert neutral\\nfactors (identity operators) factored as I = W W −1 as shown\\nin Fig. 64 (middle); clearly, this manipulation does not change\\np(y). We then regroup the factors as in Fig. 64 (bottom), which\\nagain leaves p(y) unchanged. The Wigner–Weyl factor graph is\\nthen obtained by closing the dashed boxes in Fig. 64 (bottom).\\n(The Wigner–Weyl representation has thus been obtained as a\\n“holographic” factor graph transform as in [29], [30].)\\nThe operator W encodes the relations\\nX =q−s\\n0\\n\\nX =q+s\\n\\n(79)\\n(80)\\n\\n\f22\\n\\nU\\n\\nX0\\n\\nr\\nρ\\n\\nX00\\n\\nX1\\n\\nr\\n\\nX2\\n=\\n\\nX10\\n\\nr\\n\\nX20\\n\\nUH\\nY\\nI\\n\\nI\\nU\\n\\nr X0\\nρ\\n\\nW −1\\n\\nW\\n\\nX00\\n\\nI\\n\\nr\\nW\\n\\nr\\n\\nW −1\\n\\nX1\\n\\nX2\\n\\nX10\\n\\nX20\\n\\nW −1\\n\\nW\\n\\n=\\n\\nUH\\nY\\ninitial state µW\\n\\nU\\n\\nq0\\n\\nr\\nρ\\n\\nevolution\\n\\nW\\n\\np0\\n\\nW −1\\n\\nmeasurement\\nq1\\n\\nr\\nW\\n\\nr\\n\\ntermination\\n\\np1\\n\\nq2\\nW −1\\n\\nW\\n\\np2\\n\\nW −1\\n\\n=\\n\\nUH\\nY\\nFig. 64.

We now substantiate the claim from [46]\\n\\nk:f (x(k) )>0\\n\\nand\\nX\\nk:f (x(k) )<0\\n\\nThe idea is always that the sampling probability equals the\\ndenominator (up to a scale factor), which results in simple\\nexpectations for these sums.

We can thus double the list of\\nsamples in Step 1 by adding all the conjugate configurations.\\nFor the augmented list of samples, the sum (93) becomes\\nX\\nf (x(k) ) + f (x(k) ),\\n(101)\\nk:f (x(k) )+f (x(k) )>0\\n\\nand the sums (94)–(98) can be handled analogously.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThe material of this paper has been developing over a\\nlong time.

We consider regularized versions of estimating\\nequations based on Campbell theorem derived from two classical functions:\\nPoisson likelihood and logistic regression likelihood.

We discuss the numerical\\nimplementation and assess finite sample properties in a simulation study. Finally, an application to tropical forestry datasets illustrates the use of the\\nproposed methods.\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nSpatial point pattern data arise in many contexts where interest lies in describing\\nthe distribution of an event in space. Some examples include the locations of trees in\\na forest, gold deposits mapped in a geological survey, stars in a cluster star, animal\\nsightings, locations of some specific cells in retina, or road accidents (see e.g. Møller\\nand Waagepetersen, 2004; Illian et al., 2008; Baddeley et al., 2015). Interest in\\nmethods for analyzing spatial point pattern data is rapidly expanding accross many\\nfields of science, notably in ecology, epidemiology, biology, geosciences, astronomy,\\nand econometrics.\\nOne of the main interests when analyzing spatial point pattern data is to estimate\\nthe intensity which characterizes the probability that a point (or an event) occurs in\\nan infinitesimal ball around a given location. In practice, the intensity is often assumed to be a parametric function of some measured covariates (e.g. Waagepetersen,\\n1\\n\\n\f2007; Guan and Loh, 2007; Møller and Waagepetersen, 2007; Waagepetersen, 2008;\\nWaagepetersen and Guan, 2009; Guan and Shen, 2010; Coeurjolly and Møller, 2014).\\nIn this paper, we assume that the intensity function ρ is parameterized by a vector\\nβ and has a log-linear specification\\nρ(u; β) = exp(β > z(u)),\\n\\n(1.1)\\n\\nwhere z(u) = {z1 (u), . . . , zp (u)}> are the p spatial covariates measured at location\\nu and β = {β1 , . . . , βp }> is a real p-dimensional parameter. When the intensity is a\\nfunction of many variables, covariates selection becomes inevitable.\\nVariable selection in regression has a number of purposes: provide regularization\\nfor good estimation, obtain good prediction, and identify clearly the important variables (e.g. Fan and Lv, 2010; Mazumder et al., 2011). Identifying a set of relevant\\nfeatures from a list of many features is in general combinatorially hard and computationally intensive. In this context, convex relaxation techniques such as lasso\\n(Tibshirani, 1996) have been effectively used for variable selection and parameter\\nestimation simultaneously. The lasso procedure aims at minimizing:\\n− log L(β) + λkβk1\\nwhere L(β) is the likelihood function for some model of interest. The `1 penalty\\nshrinks coefficients towards zero, and can also set coefficients to be exactly zero. In\\nthe context of variable selection, the lasso is often thought of as a convex surrogate\\nfor the best-subset selection problem:\\n− log L(β) + λkβk0 .\\nP\\nThe `0 penalty kβk0 = pi=1 I(|βi | > 0) penalizes the number of nonzero coefficients\\nin the model.\\nSince lasso can be suboptimal in model selection for some cases (e.g. Fan and Li,\\n2001; Zou, 2006; Zhang and Huang, 2008), many regularization methods then have\\nbeen developped, motivating to go beyond `1 regime to more aggressive non-convex\\npenalties which bridges the gap between `1 and `0 such as SCAD (Fan and Li, 2001)\\nand MC+ (Zhang, 2010).\\nMore recently, there were several works on implementing variable selection for\\nspatial point processes in order to reduce variance inflation from overfitting and bias\\nfrom underfitting. Thurman and Zhu (2014) focused on using adaptive lasso to select variables for inhomogeneous Poisson point processes. This study then later was\\nextended to the clustered spatial point processes by Thurman et al. (2015) who established the asymptotic properties of the estimates in terms of consistency, sparsity,\\nand normality distribution. They also compared their results employing adaptive\\nlasso to SCAD and adaptive elastic net in the simulation study and application,\\nusing both regularized weighted and unweighted estimating equations derived from\\nthe Poisson likelihood. Yue and Loh (2015) considered modelling spatial point data\\nwith Poisson, pairwise interaction point processes, and Neyman-Scott cluster models, incorporated lasso, adaptive lasso, and elastic net regularization methods into\\ngeneralized linear model framework for fitting these point models. Note that the\\n2\\n\\n\fstudy by Yue and Loh (2015) also used an estimating equation derived from the\\nPoisson likelihood. However, Yue and Loh (2015) did not provide the theoretical\\nstudy in detail. Although, in application, many penalty functions have been employed to regularization methods for spatial point processes intensity estimation,\\nthe theoretical study is still restricted to some specific penalty functions.\\nIn this paper, we propose regularized versions of estimating equations based on\\nCampbell formula derived from the Poisson and the logistic regression likelihoods to\\nestimate the intensity of the spatial point processes. We consider both convex and\\nnon-convex penalty functions. We provide general conditions on the penalty function\\nto ensure an oracle property and a central limit theorem. Thus, we extend the work\\nby Thurman et al. (2015) and obtain the theoretical results for more general penalty\\nfunctions and under less restrictive assumptions on the asymptotic covariance matrix\\n(see Remark 3). The logistic regression method proposed by Baddeley et al. (2014) is\\nas easy to implement as the Poisson likelihood method, but is less biased since it does\\nnot require deterministic numerical approximation. We prove that the estimates\\nobtained by regularizing the logistic regression likelihood can also satisfy asymptotic\\nproperties (see Remark 2). Our procedure is straightforward to implement since we\\nonly need to combine the spatstat R package with the two R packages glmnet and\\nncvreg.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives backgrounds\\non spatial point processes. Section 3 describes standard parameter estimation methods when there is no regularization, while regularization methods are developed in\\nSection 4. Section 5 develops numerical details induced by the methods introduced\\nin Sections 3-4. Asymptotic properties following the work by Fan and Li (2001)\\nfor generalized linear models are presented in Section 6. Section 7 investigates the\\nfinite-sample properties of the proposed method in a simulation study, followed by\\nan application to tropical forestry datasets in Section 8, and finished by conclusion\\nand discussion in Section 9. Proofs of the main results are postponed to Appendices\\nA-C.\\n\\n2\\n\\nSpatial point processes\\n\\nLet X be a spatial point process on Rd . Let D ⊂ Rd be a compact set of Lebesgue\\nmeasure |D| which will play the role of the observation domain. We view X as\\na locally finite random subset of Rd , i.e. the random number of points of X in\\nB, N (B), is almost surely finite whenever B ⊂ Rd is a bounded region. Suppose\\nx = {x1 , x2 , . . . , xm } denotes a realization of X observed within a bounded region\\nD, where xi , i = 1, . . . , m represent the locations of the observed points, and m is\\nthe number of points. Note that m is random and 0 ≤ m < ∞. If m = 0 then x = ∅\\nis the empty point pattern in D. For further background material on spatial point\\nprocesses, see for example Møller and Waagepetersen (2004).\\n\\n3\\n\\n\f2.1\\n\\nMoments\\n\\nThe first and second-order properties of a point process are described by intensity\\nmeasure and second-order factorial moment measure. First-order properties of a\\npoint process indicate the spatial distribution events in domain of interest. The\\nintensity measure µ on Rd is given by\\nµ(B) = EN (B), B ⊆ Rd .\\nIf the intensity measure µ can be written as\\nZ\\nµ(B) =\\nρ(u)du, B ⊆ Rd ,\\nB\\n\\nwhere ρ is a nonnegative function, then ρ is called the intensity function. If ρ is\\nconstant, then X is said to be homogeneous or first-order stationary with intensity\\nρ. Otherwise, it is said to be inhomogeneous. We may interpret ρ(u)du as the\\nprobability of occurence of a point in an infinitesimally small ball with centre u and\\nvolume du.\\nSecond-order properties of a point process indicate the spatial coincidence of\\nevents in the domain of interest. The second-order factorial moment measure α(2)\\non Rd × Rd is given by\\n(2)\\n\\nα (C) = E\\n\\n6=\\nX\\n\\nI[(u, v) ∈ C], C ⊆ Rd × Rd .\\n\\nu,v∈X\\n\\nwhere the 6= over the summation sign means that the sum runs over all pairwise\\ndifferent points u, v in X, and I[.] is the indicator function. If the second-order\\nfactorial moment measure α(2) can be written as\\nZ Z\\n(2)\\nα (C) =\\nI[(u, v) ∈ C]ρ(2) (u, v)dudv, C ⊆ Rd × Rd ,\\nwhere ρ(2) is a nonnegative function, then ρ(2) is called the second-order product\\ndensity. Intuitively, ρ(2) (u, v)dudv is the probability for observing a pair of points\\nfrom X occuring jointly in each of two infinitesimally small balls with centres u, v\\nand volume du, dv. Fore more detail description of moment measures of any order,\\nsee appendix C in Møller and Waagepetersen (2004).\\nSuppose X has intensity function ρ and second-order product density ρ(2) . Campbell theorem (see e.g. Møller and Waagepetersen, 2004) states that, for any function\\nk : Rd → [0, ∞) or k : Rd × Rd → [0, ∞)\\nZ\\nX\\nE\\nk(u) = k(u)ρ(u)du\\n(2.1)\\nu∈X\\n\\nE\\n\\n6=\\nX\\n\\nZ Z\\nk(u, v) =\\n\\nk(u, v)ρ(2) (u, v)dudv.\\n\\nu,v∈X\\n\\n4\\n\\n(2.2)\\n\\n\fIn order to study whether a point process deviates from independence (i.e., Poisson point process), we often consider the pair correlation function given by\\ng(u, v) =\\n\\nρ(2) (u, v)\\nρ(u)ρ(v)\\n\\nwhen both ρ and ρ(2) exist with the convention 0/0 = 0. For a Poisson point process\\n(Section 2.2.1), we have ρ(2) (u, v) = ρ(u)ρ(v) so that g(u, v) = 1. If, for example,\\ng(u, v) > 1 (resp. g(u, v) < 1), this indicates that pair of points are more likely\\n(resp. less likely) to occur at locations u, v than for a Poisson point process with the\\nsame intensity function as X. In the same spirit, we can define ρ(k) the k-th order\\nintensity function (see Møller and Waagepetersen, 2004, for more details). If for any\\nu, v, g(u, v) depends only on u − v, the point process X is said to be second-order\\nreweighted stationary.\\n\\n2.2\\n\\nModelling the intensity function\\n\\nWe discuss spatial point process models specified by deterministic or random intensity function. Particularly, we consider two important model classes, namely\\nPoisson and Cox processes. Poisson point processes serve as a tractable model class\\nfor no interaction or complete spatial randomness. Cox processes form major classes\\nfor clustering or aggregation. For conciseness, we focus on the two later classes of\\nmodels. We could also have presented determinantal point processes (e.g. Lavancier\\net al., 2015) which constitute an interesting class of repulsive point patterns with\\nexplicit moments. This has not been further investigated for sake of brevity. In this\\npaper, we focus on log-linear models of the intensity function given by (1.1).\\n2.2.1\\n\\nPoisson point process\\n\\nA point process X on D is a Poisson point process with intensity function ρ, assumed\\nto be locally integrable, if the following conditions are satisfied:\\n1. for any B ⊆ D with 0 ≤ µ(B) < ∞, N (B) ∼ P oisson(µ(B)),\\n2. conditionally on N (B), the points in X ∩ B are i.i.d. with joint density proportional to ρ(u), u ∈ B.\\nA Poisson point process with a log-linear intensity function is also called a modulated Poisson point process (e.g. Møller and Waagepetersen, 2007; Waagepetersen,\\n2008). In particular, for Poisson point processes, ρ(2) (u, v) = ρ(u)ρ(v), and g(u, v) =\\n1, ∀u, v ∈ D.\\n2.2.2\\n\\nCox processes\\n\\nA Cox process is a natural extension of a Poisson point process, obtained by considering the intensity function of the Poisson point process as a realization of a random\\nfield. Suppose that Λ = {Λ(u) : u ∈ D} is a nonnegative random field. If the\\n5\\n\\n\fconditional distribution of X given Λ is a Poisson point process on D with intensity\\nfunction Λ, then X is said to be a Cox process driven by Λ (see e.g. Møller and\\nWaagepetersen, 2004). There are several types of Cox processes. Here, we consider\\ntwo types of Cox processes: a Neyman-Scott point process and a log Gaussian Cox\\nprocess.\\nNeyman-Scott point processes. Let C be a stationary Poisson process\\n(mother process) with intensity κ > 0. Given C, let Xc , c ∈ C, be independent\\nPoisson processes (offspring processes) with intensity function\\nρc (u; β) = exp(β > z(u))k(u − c; ω)/κ,\\nwhere k is a probability density function determining the distribution of offspring\\npoints around the mother points parameterized by ω. Then X = ∪c∈C Xc is a\\nspecial case of an inhomogeneous Neyman-Scott point process with mothers C and\\noffspring Xc ,P\\nc ∈ C. The point process X is a Cox process driven by Λ(u) =\\n>\\nexp(β z(u)) c∈C k(u − c, ω)/κ (e.g. Waagepetersen, 2007; Coeurjolly and Møller,\\n2014) and we can verify that the intensity function of X is indeed\\nρ(u; β) = exp(β > z(u)).\\nOne example of Neyman-Scott point process is the Thomas process where\\nk(u) = (2πω 2 )−d/2 exp(−kuk2 /(2ω 2 ))\\nis the density for Nd (0, ω 2 Id ). Conditionally on a parent event at location c, children\\nevents are normally distributed around c. Smaller values of ω correspond to tighter\\nclusters, and smaller values of κ correspond to fewer number of parents. The parameter vector ψ = (κ, ω)> is referred to as the interaction parameter as it modulates\\nthe spatial interaction (or, dependence) among events.\\nLog Gaussian Cox process. Suppose that log Λ is a Gaussian random field.\\nGiven Λ, the point process X follows Poisson process. Then X is said to be a log\\nGaussian Cox process driven by Λ (Møller and Waagepetersen, 2004). If the random\\nintensity function can be written as\\nlog Λ(u) = β > z(u) + φ(u) − σ 2 /2,\\nwhere φ is a zero-mean stationary Gaussian random field with covariance function\\nc(u, v; ψ) = σ 2 R(v − u; ζ) which depends on parameter ψ = (σ 2 , ζ)> (Møller and\\nWaagepetersen, 2007; Coeurjolly and Møller, 2014). The intensity function of this\\nlog Gaussian Cox process is indeed given by\\nρ(u; β) = exp(β > z(u)).\\nOne example of correlation function is the exponential form (e.g. Waagepetersen\\nand Guan, 2009)\\nR(v − u; ζ) = exp(−ku − vk/ζ), for ζ > 0.\\nHere, ψ = (σ 2 , ζ)> constitutes the interaction parameter vector, where σ 2 is the\\nvariance and ζ is the correlation scale parameter.\\n6\\n\\n\f3\\n\\nParametric intensity estimation\\n\\nOne of the standard ways to fit models to data is by maximizing the likelihood of the\\nmodel for the data. While maximum likelihood method is feasible for parametric\\nPoisson point process models (Section 3.1), computationally intensive Markov chain\\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) methods are needed otherwise (Møller and Waagepetersen,\\n2004). As MCMC methods are not yet straightforward to implement, estimating\\nequations based on Campbell theorem have been developed (see e.g. Waagepetersen,\\n2007; Møller and Waagepetersen, 2007; Waagepetersen, 2008; Guan and Shen, 2010;\\nBaddeley et al., 2014). We review the estimating equations derived from the Poisson\\nlikelihood in Section 3.2-3.3 and from the logistic regression likelihood in Section 3.4.\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nMaximum likelihood estimation\\n\\nFor an inhomogeneous Poisson point process with intensity function ρ parameterized\\nby β, the likelihood function is\\n\u0012Z\\n\u0013\\nY\\n\u0001\\nL(β) =\\nρ(u; β) exp\\n1 − ρ(u; β) du ,\\nD\\n\\nu∈X∩D\\n\\nand the log-likelihood function of β is\\n`(β) =\\n\\nZ\\n\\nX\\n\\nlog ρ(u; β) −\\n\\nwhere we have omitted the constant term\\nhas log-linear form (1.1), (3.1) reduces to\\n`(β) =\\n\\nX\\n\\nρ(u; β)du,\\n\\n(3.1)\\n\\nD\\n\\nu∈X∩D\\n\\nR\\n\\n1du = |D|.

By applying Campbell theorem (2.1) to the\\nscore function, i.e. the gradient vector of `(β) denoted by `(1) (β), we have\\nZ\\nX\\n(1)\\nE` (β) = E\\nz(u) −\\nz(u) exp(β > z(u))du\\nD\\n\\nZ u∈X∩D\\nZ\\n>\\n=\\nz(u) exp(β 0 z(u))du −\\nz(u) exp(β > z(u))du\\nD\\nZD\\n>\\n=\\nz(u)(exp(β >\\n0 z(u)) − exp(β z(u)))du = 0\\nD\\n\\n7\\n\\n\fwhen β = β 0 . So, the score function of the Poisson log-likelihood appears to be an\\nunbiased estimating equation, even though X is not a Poisson point process. The\\nestimator maximizing (3.1) is referred to as the Poisson estimator. The properties of\\nthe Poisson estimator have been carefully studied. Schoenberg (2005) showed that\\nthe Poisson estimator is still consistent for a class of spatio-temporal point process\\nmodels. The asymptotic normality for a fixed observation domain was obtained by\\nWaagepetersen (2007) while Guan and Loh (2007) established asymptotic normality\\nunder an increasing domain assumption and for suitable mixing point processes.\\nRegarding the parameter ψ (see Section 2.2.2), Waagepetersen and Guan (2009)\\nstudied a two-step procedure to estimate both β and ψ, and they proved that, under\\ncertain mixing conditions, the parameter estimates (β̂, ψ̂) enjoy the properties of\\nconsistency and asymptotic normality.\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nWeighted Poisson likelihood\\n\\nAlthough the estimating equation approach derived from the Poisson likelihood is\\nsimpler and faster to implement than maximum likelihood estimation, it potentially\\nproduces a less efficient estimate than that of maximum likelihood (Waagepetersen,\\n2007; Guan and Shen, 2010) because information about interaction of events is ignored. To regain some lack of efficiency, Guan and Shen (2010) proposed a weighted\\nPoisson log-likelihood function given by\\nZ\\nX\\nw(u)ρ(u; β)du,\\n(3.2)\\n`(w; β) =\\nw(u) log ρ(u; β) −\\nD\\n\\nu∈X∩D\\n\\nwhere w(·) is a weight surface. By regarding (3.2), we see that a larger weight w(u)\\nmakes the observations in the infinitesimal region du more influent. By Campbell\\ntheorem, `(1) (w; β) is still an unbiased estimating equation. In addition, Guan\\nand Shen (2010) proved that, under some conditions, the parameter estimates are\\nconsistent and asymptotically normal.\\nGuan and Shen (2010) showed that a weight surface w(·) that minimizes the trace\\nof the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of the estimates maximizing (3.2) can\\nresult in more efficient estimates than Poisson estimator. In particular, the proposed\\nweight surface is\\nw(u) = {1 + ρ(u)f (u)}−1 ,\\nR\\nwhere f (u) = D {g(kv − uk; ψ) − 1}du and g(·) is the pair correlation function.\\nFor a Poisson point process, note that f (u) = 0 and hence w(u) = 1, which reduces to maximum likelihood estimation. For general point processes, the weight\\nsurface depends on both the intensity function and the pair correlation function,\\nthus incorporates information on both inhomogeneity and dependence of the spatial\\npoint processes. When clustering is present so that g(v − u) > 1, then f (u) > 0\\nand hence the weight decreases with ρ(u). The weight surface can be achieved by\\nsetting ŵ(u) = {1 + ρ̂(u)fˆ(u)}−1 . To get the estimate ρ̂(u), β is substituted by\\nβ̃ given by Poisson estimates, that is, ρ̂(u) = ρ(u; β̃). Alternatively, ρ̂(u) can also\\n8\\n\\n\fbe computed nonparametrically by kernel method. Furthermore, Guan and Shen\\n(2010) suggessted to approximate f (u) by K(r) − πr2 , where K(·) is the Ripley’s\\nK−function estimated by\\nK̂(r) =\\n\\n6=\\nX\\n\\nI[ku − vk ≤ r]\\n.\\nρ̂(u)ρ̂(v)|D\\n∩\\nD\\nu−v |\\nu,v∈X∩D\\n\\nGuan et al. (2015) extended the study by Guan and Shen (2010) and considered\\nmore complex estimating equations. Specifically, w(u)z(u) is replaced by a function\\nh(u; β) in the derivative of (3.2) with respect to β. The procedure results in a\\nslightly more efficient estimate than the one obtained from (3.2). However, the\\ncomputational cost is more important and since we combine estimating equations\\nand penalization methods (see Section 4.1), we have not considered this extension.\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nLogistic regression likelihood\\n\\nAlthough the estimating equations discussed in Section 3.2 and 3.3 are unbiased,\\nthese methods do not, in general, produce unbiased estimator in practical implementations. Waagepetersen (2008) and Baddeley et al. (2014) proposed another\\nestimating function which is indeed close to the score of the Poisson log-likelihood\\nbut is able to obtain less biased estimator than Poisson estimates. In addition,\\ntheir proposed estimating equation is in fact the derivative of the logistic regression\\nlikelihood.\\nFollowing Baddeley et al. (2014), we define the weighted logistic regression loglikelihood function by\\n\u0013\\n\u0012\\nX\\nρ(u; β)\\n`(w; β) =\\nw(u) log\\nδ(u) + ρ(u; β)\\nu∈X∩D\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\nZ\\nρ(u; β) + δ(u)\\nw(u)δ(u) log\\n−\\ndu,\\n(3.3)\\nδ(u)\\nD\\nwhere δ(u) is a nonnegative real-valued function. Its role as well as an explanation of the name ’logistic method’ will be explained further in Section 5.2. Note\\nthat the score of (3.3) is an unbiased estimating equation. Waagepetersen (2008)\\nshowed asymptotic normality for Poisson and certain clustered point processes for\\nthe estimator obtained from a similar procedure.

As a continuous shrinkage method, ridge regression achieves its better prediction through a bias-variance\\ntrade-off. Ridge can also be extended to fit generalized linear models. However,\\nthe ridge cannot reduce model complexity since it always keeps all the predictors\\nin the model. Then, it was introduced a method called lasso (Tibshirani, 1996),\\nwhere it employs `1 penalty to obtain variable selection and parameter estimation\\nsimultaneously. Despite lasso enjoys some attractive statistical properties, it has\\nsome limitations in some senses (Fan and Li, 2001; Zou and Hastie, 2005; Zou, 2006;\\nZhang and Huang, 2008; Zhang, 2010), making huge possibilities to develop other\\nmethods. In the scenario where there are high correlations among predictors, Zou\\nand Hastie (2005) proposed an elastic net technique which is a convex combination\\nbetween `1 and `2 penalties. This method is particularly useful when the number\\nof predictors is much larger than the number of observations since it can select or\\neliminate the strongly correlated predictors together.\\nThe lasso procedure suffers from nonnegligible bias and does not satisfy an oracle\\nproperty asymptotically (Fan and Li, 2001). Fan and Li (2001) and Zhang (2010),\\namong others, introduced non-convex penalties to get around these drawbacks. The\\nidea is to bridge the gap between `0 and `1 , by trying to keep unbiased the estimates\\nof nonzero coefficients and by shrinking the less important variables to be exactly\\nzero. The rationale behind the non-convex penalties such as SCAD and MC+ can\\nalso be understood by considering its first derivative (see Table 1). They start by\\napplying the similar rate of penalization as the lasso, and then continuously relax\\nthat penalization until the rate of penalization drops to zero. However, employing\\nnon-convex penalties in regression analysis, the main challenge is often in the minimization of the possible non-convex objective function when the non-convexity of\\nthe penalty is no longer dominated by the convexity of the likelihood function. This\\nissue has been carefully studied. Fan and Li (2001) proposed the local quadratic approximation (LQA). Zou and Li (2008) proposed a local linear approximation (LLA)\\n\\n11\\n\\n\fwhich yields an objective function that can be optimized using least angle regression (LARS) algorithm (Efron et al., 2004). Finally, Breheny and Huang (2011) and\\nMazumder et al. (2011) investigated the application of coordinate descent algorithm\\nto non-convex penalties.\\nTable 2: Details of some regularization methods.\\nMethod\\n\\nPp\\n\\nRidge\\n\\nPp\\n\\nLasso\\n\\nPp\\n\\nλ|βj |\\n\\n*\\n\\nEnet\\n\\nPp\\n\\nλ{γ|βj | + 21 (1 − γ)βj2 }\\n\\nAL*\\n\\nPp\\n\\nλj |βj |\\n\\nAenet*\\n\\nPp\\n\\nSCAD\\n\\nMC+\\n*\\n\\nj=1\\n\\npλj (|βj |)\\n\\n1\\n2\\nj=1 2 λβj\\nj=1\\nj=1\\nj=1\\n\\nλj {γ|βj | + 21 (1 − γ)βj2 }\\n\\n\\n\\nλθ 1 2 2 if (θ ≤ λ)\\nPp\\nγλθ− 2 (θ +λ )\\np\\n(|β\\n|),\\nwith\\np\\n(θ)\\n=\\nif (λ ≤ θ ≤ γλ)\\nj\\nλ\\nj=1 λ\\nγ−1\\n\\n\\n λ2 (γ 2 −1)\\nif (θ ≥ γλ)\\n2(γ−1)\\n\u0011\\no\\nPp n\u0010\\nβj2\\n1\\n2\\nλ|βj | − 2γ I(|βj | ≤ γλ) + 2 γλ I(|βj | ≥ γλ)\\nj=1\\nj=1\\n\\nEnet, AL and Aenet, respectively, stand for elastic net, adaptive\\nlasso and adaptive elastic net\\n\\nIn (4.1), it is worth emphasizing that we allow each direction to have a different\\nregularization parameter. By doing this, the `1 and elastic net penalty functions\\nare extended to the adaptive lasso (e.g. Zou, 2006) and adaptive elastic net (e.g.\\nZou and Zhang, 2009). Table 2 details the regularization methods considered in this\\nstudy.\\n\\n5\\n\\nNumerical methods\\n\\nWe present numerical aspects in this section. For nonregularized estimation, there\\nare two approaches that we consider. Weighted Poisson regression is explained in\\nSection 5.1, while logistic regression is reviewed in Section 5.2. Penalized estimation\\nprocedure is done by employing coordinate descent algorithm (Section 5.3). We\\nseparate the use of the convex and non-convex penalties in Section 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.\\n\\n5.1\\n\\nWeighted Poisson regression\\n\\nBerman and Turner (1992) developed a numerical quadrature method to approximate maximum likelihood estimation for an inhomogeneous Poisson point process.\\nThey approximated the likelihood by a finite sum that had the same analytical form\\nas the weighted likelihood of generalized linear model with Poisson response. This\\nmethod was then extended to Gibbs point processes by Baddeley and Turner (2000).\\n\\n12\\n\\n\fSuppose we approximate the integral term in (3.1) by Riemann sum approximation\\nZ\\nM\\nX\\nρ(u; β)du ≈\\nvi ρ(ui ; β)\\nD\\n\\ni\\n\\nwhere ui , i = 1, . . . , M are points in D consisting of the m data points\\nP and M − m\\ndummy points. The quadrature weights vi > 0 are such that\\ni vi = |D|. To\\nimplement this method, the domain is firstly partitioned into M rectangular pixels\\nof equal area, denoted by a. Then one dummy point is placed in the center of\\nthe pixel. Let ∆i be an indicator whether the point is an event of point process\\n(∆i = 1) or a dummy point (∆i = 0). Without loss of generality, let ui , . . . , um\\nbe the observed events and um+1 , . . . , uM be the dummy points. Thus, the Poisson\\nlog-likelihood function (3.1) can be approximated and rewritten as\\n\\n`(β) ≈\\n\\nM\\nX\\n\\nvi {yi log ρ(ui ; β) − ρ(ui ; β)}, where yi = vi−1 ∆i .\\n\\n(5.1)\\n\\ni\\n\\nEquation (5.1) corresponds to a quasi Poisson log-likelihood function. Maximizing\\n(5.1) is equivalent to fitting a weighted Poisson generalized linear model, which can\\nbe performed using standard statistical software. Similarly, we can approximate the\\nweighted Poisson log-likelihood function (3.2) using numerical quadrature method\\nby\\n`(w; β) ≈\\n\\nM\\nX\\n\\nwi vi {yi log ρ(ui ; β) − ρ(ui ; β)}.\\n\\n(5.2)\\n\\ni\\n\\nwhere wi is the value of the weight surface at point i. The estimate ŵi is obtained as\\nsuggested by Guan and Shen (2010). The similarity beetween (5.1) and (5.2) allows\\nus to compute the estimates using software for generalized linear model as well.\\nThis fact is in particular exploited in the ppm function in the spatstat R package\\n(Baddeley and Turner, 2005; Baddeley et al., 2015) with option method=\"mpl\".\\nTo make the presentation becomes more general, the number of dummy points is\\ndenoted by nd2 for the next sections.\\n\\n5.2\\n\\nLogistic regression\\n\\nTo perform well, the Berman-Turner approximation often requires a quite large\\nnumber of dummy points. Hence, fitting such generalized linear models can be\\ncomputationally intensive, especially when dealing with a quite large number of\\npoints. When the unbiased estimating equations are approximated using deterministic numerical approximation as in Section 5.1, it does not always produce unbiased\\nestimator. To achieve unbiased estimator, we estimate (3.3) by\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\n\u0013\\n\u0012\\nX\\nX\\nδ(u)\\nρ(u; β)\\n+\\nw(u) log\\n,\\n`(w; β) ≈\\nw(u) log\\nδ(u)\\n+\\nρ(u;\\nβ)\\nρ(u;\\nβ)\\n+\\nδ(u)\\nu∈D∩D\\nu∈X∩D\\n(5.3)\\n13\\n\\n\fwhere D is dummy point process independent of X and with intensity function δ.\\nThe form (5.3) is related to the estimating equation defined by Baddeley et al. (2014,\\neq. 7). Besides that, we consider this form since if we apply Campbell theorem to\\nthe last term of (5.3), we obtain\\n\u0013 Z\\n\u0012\\n\u0013\\n\u0012\\nX\\nρ(u; β) + δ(u)\\nδ(u)\\n=\\nw(u)δ(u) log\\ndu,\\nE\\nw(u) log\\nρ(u;\\nβ)\\n+\\nδ(u)\\nδ(u)\\nD\\nu∈D∩D\\nwhich is exactly what we have in the last term of (3.3). In addition, conditional on\\nX∪D, (5.3) is the weighted likelihood function for Bernoulli trials, y(u) = 1{u ∈ X}\\nfor u ∈ X ∪ D, with\\n\u0001\\nexp − log δ(u) + β > z(u)\\nρ(u; β)\\n\u0001.\\nP{y(u) = 1} =\\n=\\nδ(u) + ρ(u; β)\\n1 + exp − log δ(u) + β > z(u)\\nPrecisely, (5.3) is a weighted logistic regression with offset term − log δ. Thus,\\nparameter estimates can be straightforwardly obtained using standard software for\\ngeneralized linear models. This approach is in fact provided in the spatstat package\\nin R by calling the ppm function with option method=\"logi\" (Baddeley et al., 2014,\\n2015).\\nIn spatstat, the dummy point process D generates nd2 points in average in\\nD from a Poisson, binomial, or stratified binomial point process. Baddeley et al.\\n(2014) suggested to choose δ(u) = 4m/|D|, where m is the number of points (so,\\nnd2 = 4m). Furthermore, to determine δ, this option can be considered as a starting\\npoint for a data-driven approach (see Baddeley et al., 2014, for further details).\\n\\n5.3\\n\\nCoordinate descent algorithm\\n\\nLARS algorithm (Efron et al., 2004) is a remarkably efficient method for computing\\nan entire path of lasso solutions. For linear models, the computational cost is of\\norder O(M p2 ), which is the same order as a least squares fit. Coordinate descent algorithm (Friedman et al., 2007, 2010) appears to be a more competitive algorithm for\\ncomputing the regularization paths by costs O(M p) operations. Therefore we adopt\\ncyclical coordinate descent methods, which can work really fast on large datasets\\nand can take advantage of sparsity. Coordinate descent algorithms optimize a target\\nfunction with respect to a single parameter at a time, iteratively cycling through all\\nparameters until convergence criterion is reached. We detail this for some convex\\nand non-convex penalty functions in the next two sections. Here, we only present\\nthe coordinate descent algorithm for fitting generalized weighted Poisson regression.\\nA similar approach is used to fit penalized weighted logistic regression.\\n5.3.1\\n\\nConvex penalty functions\\n\\nSince `(w; β) given by (5.2) is a concave function of the parameters, the NewtonRaphson algorithm used to maximize the penalized log-likelihood function can be\\ndone using the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) method. If the current\\n14\\n\\n\festimate of the parameters is β̃, we construct a quadratic approximation of the\\nweighted Poisson log-likelihood function using Taylor’s expansion:\\nM\\n\\n1 X\\n2\\n`(w; β) ≈ `Q (w; β) = −\\nνi (yi∗ − z>\\ni β) + C(β̃),\\n2M i\\n\\n(5.4)\\n\\nwhere C(β̃) is a constant, yi∗ are the working response values and νi are the weights,\\nνi = wi vi exp(z>\\ni β̃)\\nyi∗ = z>\\ni β̃ +\\n\\nyi − exp(z>\\ni β̃)\\nexp(z>\\ni β̃)\\n\\n.\\n\\nRegularized Poisson linear model works by firstly identifying a decreasing sequence of λ ∈ [λmin , λmax ], for which starting with minimum value of λmax such that\\nthe entire vector β̂ = 0. For each value of λ, an outer loop is created to compute\\n`Q (w; β) at β̃. Secondly, a coordinate descent method is applied to solve a penalized\\nweighted least squares problem\\nminp Ω(β) = minp {−`Q (w; β) +\\n\\nβ∈R\\n\\nβ∈R\\n\\np\\nX\\n\\npλj (|βj |)}.\\n\\n(5.5)\\n\\nj=1\\n\\nThe coordinate descent method is explained as follows.

(2007) have provided the form of the coordinate-wise update for\\npenalized regression using several penalties such as nonnegative garrote (Breiman,\\n1995), lasso, elastic net, fused lasso (Tibshirani et al., 2005), group lasso (Yuan and\\nLin, 2006), Berhu penalty (Owen, 2007), and LAD-lasso (Wang et al., 2007a). For\\ninstance, the coordinate-wise update for the elastic net, which embraces the ridge\\nand lasso regularization by setting respectively γ to 0 or 1, is\\n!\\nM\\nX\\n(j)\\nS\\nνj zij (yi − ỹi ), λγ\\nβ̃j ←\\n\\ni=1\\nM\\nX\\n\\n,\\n\\n(5.6)\\n\\nνj zij2 + λ(1 − γ)\\n\\ni=1\\n(j)\\n\\nP\\n\\nwhere ỹi = β̃0 + l6=j zil β̃l is the fitted value excluding the contribution from\\ncovariate zij , and S(z, λ) is the soft-thresholding operator with value\\n\\n\\nz − λ if z > 0 and λ < |z|\\nS(z, λ) = sign(z)(|z| − λ)+ = z + λ if z < 0 and λ < |z|\\n\\n\\n0\\nif λ ≥ |z|.\\n15\\n\\n(5.7)\\n\\n\fThe update (5.6) is repeated for j = 1, . . . , p until convergence. Coordinate descent algorithm for several convex penalties is implemented in the R package glmnet\\n(Friedman et al., 2010). For (5.6), we can set γ = 0 to implement ridge and γ = 1\\nto lasso, while we set 0 < γ < 1 to apply elastic net regularization. For adaptive\\nlasso, we follow Zou (2006), take γ = 1 and replace λ by λj = λ/|β̃j |τ , where β̃ is\\nan initial estimate, say β̃(ols) or β̃(ridge), and τ is a positive tuning parameter.\\nTo avoid the computational evaluation for choosing τ , we follow Zou (2006, Section\\n3.4) and Wasserman and Roeder (2009) who also considered τ = 1, so we choose\\nλj = λ/|β̃j (ridge)|, where β̃(ridge) is the estimates obtained from ridge regression.\\nImplementing adaptive elastic net follows along similar lines.\\n5.3.2\\n\\nNon-convex penalty functions\\n\\nBreheny and Huang (2011) have investigated the application of coordinate descent\\nalgorithm to fit penalized generalized linear model using SCAD and MC+, for which\\nthe penalty is non-convex. Mazumder et al. (2011) also studied the coordinatewise optimization algorithm in linear models considering more general non-convex\\npenalties.\\nMazumder et al. (2011) concluded that, for a known current estimate θ̃, the\\nunivariate penalized least squares function Qu (θ) = 12 (θ − θ̃)2 + pλ (|θ|) should be\\nconvex to ensure that the coordinate-wise procedure converges to a stationary point.\\nMazumder et al. (2011) found that this turns out to be the case for SCAD and MC+\\npenalty, but it cannot be satisfied by bridge (or power) penalty and some cases of\\nlog-penalty.\\nBreheny and Huang (2011) derived the solution of coordinate descent algorithm\\nfor SCAD and MC+ in generalized linear models cases, and it is implemented in\\nthe ncvreg package of R. Let β̃ l be a vector containing estimates β̃l for l 6= j,\\nl, j = 1, . . . , p, and we wish to partially optimize (5.5) with respect to βj .

The estimation using\\na large value of λ tends to have smaller variance but larger biases, whereas the estimation using a small value of λ leads to have zero biases but larger variance. The\\ntrade-off between the biases and the variances yields an optimal choice of λ (Fan\\nand Lv, 2010).\\nTo select λ, it is reasonable to identify a range of λ values extending from a\\nmaximum value of λ for which all penalized coefficients are zero to λ = 0 (e.g.\\nFriedman et al., 2010; Breheny and Huang, 2011). After that, we select a λ value\\nwhich optimizes some criterion. By fixing a path of λ ≥ 0, we select the tuning\\nparameter λ which minimizes WQBIC(λ), a weighted version of the BIC criterion,\\ndefined by\\nWQBIC(λ) = −2`(w; β̂(λ)) + s(λ) log |D|,\\nP\\nwhere s(λ) = pj=1 I{β̂j (λ) 6= 0} is the number of selected covariates with nonzero\\nregression coefficients and |D| is the observation volume which represents the sample\\nsize. For linear regression models, Y = X> β̂ +\u000f, Wang et al. (2007b) proposed BICtype criterion for choosing λ by\\nBIC(λ) = log\\n\\nkY − X> β̂(λ)k2 1\\n+ log(η)DF(λ),\\nη\\nη\\n\\nwhere η is the number of observations and DF(λ) is the degree of freedom. This\\ncriterion is consistent, meaning that, it selects the correct model with probability\\napproaching 1 in large samples when a set of candidate models contains the true\\nmodel. Their findings is in line with the study of Zhang et al. (2010) for which the\\ncriterion was presented in more general way, called generalized information criterion\\n(GIC). The criterion WQBIC is the specific form of GIC proposed by Zhang et al.\\n(2010).\\nThe selection of γ for SCAD and MC+ is another task, but we fix γ = 3.7 for\\nSCAD and γ = 3 for MC+, following Fan and Li (2001) and Breheny and Huang\\n(2011) respectively, to avoid more complexities.\\n\\n6\\n\\nAsymptotic theory\\n\\nIn this section, we present the asymptotic results for the regularized weighted Poisson\\nlikelihood estimator when considering X as a d-dimensional point process observed\\nover a sequence of observation domain D = Dn , n = 1, 2, . . . which expands to Rd as\\nn → ∞. The regularization parameters λj = λn,j for j = 1, . . . , p are now indexed\\nby n. These asymptotic results also hold for the regularized unweighted Poisson\\nlikelihood estimator.

Proofs are relegated to Appendices A-C.\\nWe first show in Theorem 1 that the penalized weighted Poisson likelihood estimator converges in probability and exhibits its rate of convergence.\\nTheorem 1. Assume the conditions (C.1)-(C.8) hold and let an and cn be given\\nby (6.2) and (6.4). If an = O(|Dn |−1/2 ) and cn = o(1), then there exists a local\\nmaximizer β̂ of Q(w; β) such that kβ̂ − β 0 k = OP (|Dn |−1/2 + an ).\\n19\\n\\n\fThis implies that, if an = O(|Dn |−1/2 ) and cn = o(1), the penalized weighted\\nPoisson likelihood estimator is root-|Dn | consistent. Furthermore, we demonstrate\\nin Theorem 2 that such a root-|Dn | consistent estimator ensures the sparsity of β̂;\\nthat is, the estimate will correctly set β 2 to zero with probability tending to 1 as\\nn → ∞, and β̂ 1 is asymptotically normal.\\nTheorem 2.

If an |Dn |1/2 → 0,\\nbn |Dn |1/2 → ∞ and cn → 0 as n → ∞, the root-|Dn | consistent local maximiz>\\n>\\ners β̂ = (β̂ 1 , β̂ 2 )> in Theorem 1 satisfy:\\n(i) Sparsity: P(β̂ 2 = 0) → 1 as n → ∞,\\nd\\n\\n(ii) Asymptotic Normality: |Dn |1/2 Σn (w; β 0 )−1/2 (β̂ 1 − β 01 ) →\\n− N (0, Is ),\\nwhere\\nΣn (w; β 0 ) =|Dn |{An,11 (w; β 0 ) + |Dn |Πn }−1 {Bn,11 (w; β 0 ) + Cn,11 (w; β 0 )}\\n{An,11 (w; β 0 ) + |Dn |Πn }−1 ,\\n(6.5)\\n00\\n00\\nΠn =diag{pλn,1 (|β01 |), . . . , pλn,s (|β0s |)},\\n(6.6)\\nand where An,11 (w; β 0 ) (resp. Bn,11 (w; β 0 ), Cn,11 (w; β 0 )) is the s × s top-left corner\\nof An (w; β 0 ) (resp. Bn (w; β 0 ), Cn (w; β 0 )).\\nAs a consequence, Σn (w; β 0 ) is the asymptotic covariance matrix of β̂ 1 . Note\\nthat Σn (w; β 0 )−1/2 is the inverse of Σn (w; β 0 )1/2 , where Σn (w; β 0 )1/2 is any square\\n\u0001>\\nmatrix with Σn (w; β 0 )1/2 Σn (w; β 0 )1/2 = Σn (w; β 0 ).\\nRemark 1. For lasso and adaptive lasso, Πn = 0. For other penalties, since\\ncn = o(1), then kΠn k = o(1). Since kAn,11 (w; β 0 )k = O(|Dn |) from conditions (C.2)\\nand (C.3), |Dn | kΠn k is asymptotically negligible with respect to kAn,11 (w; β 0 )k.\\nRemark 2. Theorems 1 and 2 remain true for the regularized weighted logistic\\nregression likelihood estimates if we extend the condition (C.3) by replacing in the\\nexpression of the matrices An , Bn , and Cn , w(u) by w(u)δ(u)/(ρ(u; β) + δ(u)), u ∈\\nDn and by adding supu∈Rd δ(u) < ∞.\\nRemark 3. We want to highlight here the main theoretical differences with the work\\nby Thurman et al. (2015). First, the methodology and results are available for the\\nlogistic regression likelihood. Second, we consider very general penalty function while\\nThurman et al. (2015) only considered the adaptive lasso method. Third, we do not\\nassume, as in Thurman et al. (2015), that |Dn |−1 Mn → M as n → ∞ (where Mn\\nis An , Bn , or Cn ), when M is a positive definite matrix. Instead we assume sharper\\ncondition assuming limn→∞ νmin (|Dn |−1 Mn ) > 0, where Mn is either An or Bn +Cn\\nand νmin (M0 ) is the smallest eigenvalue of a positive definite matrix M0 . This makes\\nthe proofs a little bit more technical.\\n\\n20\\n\\n\f6.3\\n\\nDiscussion of the conditions\\n\\nWe adopt the conditions (C.1)-(C.6) based on the paper from Coeurjolly and Møller\\n(2014). In condition (C.1), the assumption that E contains o in its interior can\\nbe made without loss of generality. If instead u is an interior point of E, then\\ncondition (C.1) could be modified to that any ball with centre u and radius r > 0 is\\ncontained in Dn = nE for all sufficiently large n. Condition (C.3) is quite standard.\\nFrom conditions (C.2)-(C.5), the matrices An (w; β 0 ), Bn (w; β 0 ) and Cn (w; β 0 ) are\\nbounded by |Dn | (see e.g. Coeurjolly and Møller, 2014).\\nCombination of conditions (C.1)-(C.6) are used to establish a central limit theo(1)\\nrem for |Dn |−1/2 `n (w; β 0 ) using a general central limit theorem for triangular arrays\\nof nonstationary random fields obtained by Karácsony (2006), which is an extension from Bolthausen (1982), then later extended to nonstationary random fields\\nby Guyon (1995). As pointed out by Coeurjolly and Møller (2014), condition (C.6)\\nis a spatial average assumption like when establishing asymptotic normality of ordinary least square estimators for linear models. This condition is also useful to\\nmake sure that the matrix |Dn |−1 {Bn (w; β 0 ) + Cn (w; β 0 )} is invertible. Conditions\\n(C.6)-(C.7) ensure that the matrix Σn (w; β 0 ) is invertible for sufficiently large n.\\nConditions (C.1)-(C.6) are discussed in details for several models by Coeurjolly and\\nMøller (2014). They are satisfied for a large class of intensity functions and a large\\nclass of models including Poisson and Cox processes discussed in Section 2.2.\\nCondition (C.8) controls the higher order terms in Taylor expansion of the penalty\\nfunction. Roughly speaking, we ask the penalty function to be at least Lipschitz and\\nthrice differentiable in a neighborhood of the true parameter vector. As it is, the\\ncondition looks technical, however, it is obviously satisfied for ridge, lasso, elastic\\nnet (and the adaptive versions). According to the choice of λn , it is satisfied for\\nSCAD and MC+ when |β0j |, for j = 1, . . . , s, is not equal to γλn and/or λn .\\nTheorem 2 requires the conditions an |Dn |1/2 → 0, bn |Dn |1/2 → ∞ and cn →\\n0 as n → ∞ simultaneously. By requiring these assumptions, the corresponding\\npenalized weighted Poisson likelihood estimators possess the oracle property and\\nperform as well as weighted Poisson likelihood estimator which estimates β 1 knowing\\nthe fact that β 2 = 0.\\nFor the ridge regularization method, bn = 0, preventing from applying Theorem 2\\nfor this penalty. For lasso and elastic net, an = K2 bn for some constant K2 > 0\\n(K2 =1 for lasso). The two conditions an |Dn |1/2 → 0 and bn |Dn |1/2 → ∞ as n → ∞\\ncannot be satisfied simultaneously. This is different for the adaptive versions where\\na compromise can be found by adjusting the λn,j ’s, as well as the two non-convex\\npenalties SCAD and MC+, for which λn can be adjusted. For the regularization\\nmethods considered in this paper, the condition cn → 0 is implied by the condition\\nan |Dn |1/2 → 0 as n → ∞.\\n\\n7\\n\\nSimulation study\\n\\nWe conduct a simulation study with three different scenarios, described in Section\\n7.1, to compare the estimates of the regularized Poisson likelihood (PL) and that\\n21\\n\\n\fof the regularized weighted Poisson likelihood (WPL). We also want to explore the\\nbehaviour of the estimates using different regularization methods. Empirical findings\\nare presented in Section 7.2. Furthermore, we compare, in Section 7.3, the estimates\\nof the regularized (un)weighted logistic likelihood and the ones of the regularized\\n(un)weighted Poisson likelihood.\\n\\n7.1\\n\\nSimulation set-up\\n\\nThe setting is quite similar to that of Waagepetersen (2007) and Thurman et al.\\n(2015). The spatial domain is D = [0, 1000] × [0, 500]. We center and scale the\\n201 × 101 pixel images of elevation (x1 ) and gradient of elevation (x2 ) contained in\\nthe bei datasets of spatstat library in R (R Core Team, 2016), and use them as\\ntwo true covariates. In addition, we create three different scenarios to define extra\\ncovariates:\\nScenario 1. We generate eighteen 201 × 101 pixel images of covariates as standard\\nGaussian white noise and denote them by x3 , . . . , x20 . We define z(u) =\\nx(u) = {x1 (u), . . . , x20 (u)}> as the covariates vector. The regression\\ncoefficients for z3 , . . . , z20 are set to zero.\\nScenario 2. First, we generate eighteen 201 × 101 pixel images of covariates as in\\nthe scenario 1. Second, we transform them, together with x1 and x2 , to\\nhave multicollinearity. Third, we define z(u) = V> x(u), where x(u) =\\n{x1 (u), . . . , x20 (u)}> . More precisely, V is such that Ω = V> V, and\\n(Ω)ij = (Ω)ji = 0.7|i−j| for i, j = 1, . . . , 20, except (Ω)12 = (Ω)21 = 0, to\\npreserve the correlation between x1 and x2 . The regression coefficients\\nfor z3 , . . . , z20 are set to zero.\\nScenario 3. We consider a more complex situation. We center and scale the 13 soil\\nnutrients covariates obtained from the study in tropical forest of Barro\\nColorado Island (BCI) in central Panama (see Condit, 1998; Hubbell\\net al., 1999, 2005), and use them as the extra covariates. Together with\\nx1 and x2 , we keep the structure of the covariance matrix to preserve\\nthe complexity of the situation. In this setting, we have z(u) = x(u) =\\n{x1 (u), . . . , x15 (u)}> . The regression coefficients for z3 , . . . , z15 are set\\nto zero.\\nThe different maps of the covariates obtained from scenarios 2 and 3 are depicted\\nin Appendix D. Except for z3 which has high correlation with z2 , the extra covariates\\nobtained from scenario 2 tend to have a constant value (Figure 3). This is completely\\ndifferent from the ones obtained from scenario 3 (Figure 4).\\nThe mean number of points over the domain D, µ, is chosen to be 1600. We\\nset the true intensity function to be ρ(u; β 0 ) = {β0 + β1 z1 (u) + β2 z2 (u)}, where\\nβ1 = 2 represents a relatively large effect of elevation, β2 = 0.75 reflects a relatively\\nsmall effect of gradient, and β0 is selected such that each realization has 1600 points\\nin average. Furthermore, we erode regularly the domain D such that, with the\\n22\\n\\n\fsame intensity function, the mean number of points over the new domain D R\\nbecomes 400. The erosion is used to observe the convergence of the procedure\\nas the observation domain expands. We consider the default number of dummy\\npoints for the Poisson likelihood, denoted by nd2 , as suggested in the spatstat R\\npackage, i.e. nd2 ≈ 4m, where m is the number of points. With these scenarios, we\\nsimulate 2000 spatial point patterns from a Thomas point process using the rThomas\\nfunction in the spatstat package. We also consider two different κ parameters\\n(κ = 5 × 10−4 , κ = 5 × 10−5 ) as different levels of spatial interaction and let ω = 20.\\nFor each of the four combinations of κ and µ, we fit the intensity to the simulated\\npoint pattern realizations. We also fit the oracle model which only uses the two true\\ncovariates.\\nAll models are fitted using modified internal function in spatstat (Baddeley\\net al., 2015), glmnet (Friedman et al., 2010), and ncvreg (Breheny and Huang,\\n2011). A modification of the ncvreg R package is required to include the penalized\\nweighted Poisson and logistic likelihood methods.\\n\\n7.2\\n\\nSimulation results\\n\\nTo better understand the behaviour of Thomas processes designed in this study,\\nFigure 1 shows the plot of the four realizations using different κ and µ. The smaller\\nvalue of κ, the tighter the clusters since there are fewer parents.

Similarly to Bühlmann and Van De Geer\\n(2011), the indices we consider are the true positive rate (TPR), the false positive\\nrate (FPR), and the positive predictive value (PPV).

Therefore, we want to find the methods which have a TPR and a PPV\\nclose to 100%, and a FPR close to 0.\\n\\n25\\n\\n\fGenerally, for both the penalized PL and the penalized WPL methods, the best\\nselection properties are obtained for a larger value of κ which shows weaker spatial\\ndependence. For a more clustered one, indicated by a smaller value of κ, it seems\\nmore difficult to select the true covariates. As µ increases from 400 (Table 4) to\\n1600 (Table 5), the TPR tends to improve, so the model can select both z1 and z2\\nmore frequently.\\nRidge, lasso, and elastic net are the regularization methods that cannot satisfy\\nour theorems. It is firstly emphasized that all covariates are always selected by the\\nridge so that the rates are never changed whatever method used. For the penalized\\nPL with lasso and elastic net regularization, it is shown that they tend to have\\nquite large value of FPR, meaning that they wrongly keep the noisy covariates more\\nfrequently. When the penalized WPL is applied, we gain smaller FPR, but we suffer\\nfrom smaller TPR at the same time. This smaller TPR actually comes from the\\nunselection of z2 which has smaller coefficient than that of z1 .\\nWhen we apply adaptive lasso, adaptive elastic net, SCAD, and MC+, we achieve\\nbetter performance, especially for FPR which is closer to zero which automatically\\nimproves the PPV. Adaptive elastic net (resp. elastic net) has slightly larger FPR\\nthan adaptive lasso (resp. lasso). Among all regularization methods considered in\\nthis paper, adaptive lasso seems to outperform the other ones.\\nConsidering scenarios 1 and 2, we observe best selection properties for the penalized PL combined with adaptive lasso. As the design is getting more complex for\\nscenario 3, applying the penalized PL suffers from much larger FPR, indicating that\\nthis method may not be able to overcome the complicated situation. However, when\\nwe use the penalized WPL, the properties seem to be more stable for the different\\ndesigns of simulation study. One more advantage when considering the penalized\\nWPL is that we can remove almost all extra covariates. It is worth noticing that\\nwe may suffer from smaller TPR when we apply the penalized WPL, but we lose\\nthe only less informative covariates. From Tables 4 and 5, when we are faced with\\ncomplex situation, we would recommend the use of the penalized WPL method with\\nadaptive lasso penalty if the focus is on selection properties. Otherwise, the use of\\nthe penalized PL combined with adaptive lasso penalty is more preferable.\\nTables 6 and 7 give the prediction properties of the estimates in terms of biases,\\nstandard deviations (SD), and square root of mean squared errors (RMSE), some\\ncriterions we define by\\n\" p\\n\" p\\n# 12\\n# 21\\n\" p\\n# 21\\nX\\nX\\nX\\nσ̂j2 , RMSE =\\nÊ(β̂j − βj )2 ,\\nBias =\\n{Ê(β̂j ) − βj }2 , SD =\\nj=1\\n\\nj=1\\n\\nj=1\\n\\nwhere Ê(β̂j ) and σ̂j2 are respectively the empirical mean and variance of the estimates\\nβ̂j , for j = 1, . . . , p, where p = 20 for scenarios 1 and 2, and p = 15 for scenario 3.\\nIn general, the properties improve with larger value of κ and µ due to weaker\\nspatial dependence and larger sample size. For the oracle model where the model\\ncontains only z1 and z2 , the WPL estimates are more efficient than the PL estimates,\\nparticularly in the more clustered case, agreeing with the findings by Guan and Shen\\n(2010).\\n26\\n\\n\fTable 6: Empirical prediction properties (Bias, SD, and RMSE) based on 2000\\nreplications of Thomas processes on the domain D R (µ = 400) for different\\nvalues of κ and for the three different scenarios.

The regularized WPL has a\\nlarger bias since this method does not select z2 much more frequently. Furthermore,\\nweighted method seems to introduce extra bias, even though the regularization is\\nnot considered as in the oracle model. For a low clustered process, the SD using the\\npenalized WPL is similar to that of the penalized PL which may be because of the\\nweaker dependence represented by larger κ, making weight surface w(·) closer to 1.\\nHowever, a larger RMSE is obtained from the penalized WPL. When we observe\\nthe more clustered process, we obtain smaller SD using the penalized WPL which\\nexplains why in some cases (mainly scenario 3) the RMSE gets smaller.\\nFor the ridge method, the bias is closest to that of the oracle model, but it has\\nthe largest SD. Among the regularization methods, the adaptive lasso method has\\nthe best performance in terms of prediction.\\nConsidering scenarios 1 and 2, we obtain best properties when we apply the\\npenalized PL with adaptive lasso penalty. As the design is getting much more\\ncomplex for scenario 3, when we use the penalized PL with adaptive lasso, the\\nSD is doubled and even quadrupled due to the overselection of many unimportant\\ncovariates. In particular, for the more clustered process, the better properties are\\neven obtained by applying the regularized WPL combined with adaptive lasso. From\\nTables 6 and 7, when the focus is on prediction properties, we would recommend to\\napply the penalized WPL combined with adaptive lasso penalty when the observed\\npoint pattern is very clustered and when covariates have a complex stucture of\\ncovariance matrix. Otherwise, the use of the penalized PL combined with adaptive\\nlasso penalty is more favorable. Our recommendations in terms of prediction support\\nas what we recommend in terms of selection.\\n\\n7.3\\n\\nLogistic regression\\n\\nOur concern here is to compare the estimates of the penalized (un)weighted logistic\\nlikelihood to that of the penalized (un)weighted Poisson likelihood with different\\nnumber of dummy points. We remind that the number of dummy points comes up\\nwhen we discretize the integral terms in (3.2) and in (3.3). In the following, to ease\\nthe presentation, we use the term Poisson estimates (resp. logistic estimates) for\\nparameter estimates obtained using the regularized Poisson likelihood (resp. the\\nregularized logistic regression likelihood).\\nWe consider three different numbers of dummy points denoted by nd2 . By these\\ndifferent numbers of dummy points, we want to observe the properties with three\\ndifferent situations: (a) nd2 < m, (b) nd2 ≈ m, and (c) nd2 > m, where m is the\\nnumber of points. In the following, m ≈ 1600 and nd2 = 400, 1600, and 6400. Note\\nthat the choice by default from the Poisson likelihood in spatstat corresponds to\\ncase (c). Baddeley et al. (2014) showed that for datasets with very large number\\nof points and for very structured point processes, the logistic likelihood method\\nis clearly preferable as it requires a smaller number of dummy points to perform\\nquickly and efficiently. We want to investigate a similar comparison when these\\nmethods are regularized.\\n29\\n\\n\fTable 8: Empirical selection properties (TPR, FPR, and PPV in %) based on 2000\\nreplications of Thomas processes on the domain D (µ = 1600) for κ = 5 × 10−5 , for\\ntwo different scenarios, and for three different numbers of dummy points.

For unweighted versions of the procedure, the regularized logistic method outperforms the regularized Poisson method when nd = 20,\\ni.e. when the number of dummy points is much smaller than the number of points.\\nWhen nd2 ≈ m or nd2 > m, the methods tend to have similar performances.

In addition,\\nfor scenario 3 which considers a more complex situation, the methods tend to select\\nthe noisy covariates much more frequently.\\nEmpirical biases, standard deviation and square root of mean squared errors\\nare presented in Table 9. We include all empirical results for the standard Poisson\\nand logistic estimates (i.e. no regularization is considered). Let us first consider\\nthe unweighted methods with no regularization. The logistic method clearly has\\nsmaller bias, especially when nd = 20, which explains why in most situations the\\nRMSE is smaller. However, for the weighted methods, although the logistic method\\nhas smaller bias in general, it produces much larger SD, leading to larger RMSE\\nfor all cases. When we compare the weighted and the unweighted methods for\\nlogistic estimates, in general, not only do we fail to reduce the SD, but we also have\\nlarger bias. When the adaptive lasso regularization is considered, combined with\\nthe unweighted methods, we can preserve the bias in general and simultaneously\\nimprove the SD, and hence improve the RMSE.

When\\nthe number of dummy points should be chosen as nd2 < m, the logistic likelihood\\nmethod is more favorable. Our recommendations regarding whether weighted or\\nunweighted methods follow the ones as in Section 7.2.\\n\\n8\\n\\nApplication to forestry datasets\\n\\nIn a 50-hectare region (D = 1, 000m × 500m) of the tropical moist forest of Barro\\nColorado Island (BCI) in central Panama, censuses have been carried out where all\\nfree-standing woody stems at least 10 mm diameter at breast height were identified,\\ntagged, and mapped, resulting in maps of over 350,000 individual trees with more\\n31\\n\\n\fthan 300 species (see Condit, 1998; Hubbell et al., 1999, 2005). It is of interest\\nto know how the very high number of different tree species continues to coexist,\\nprofiting from different habitats determined by e.g. topography or soil properties\\n(see e.g. Waagepetersen, 2007; Waagepetersen and Guan, 2009). In particular, the\\nselection of covariates among topological attributes and soil minerals as well as the\\nestimation of their coefficients are becoming our most concern.\\n\\nFigure 2: Maps of locations of BPL trees (top left), elevation (top right), slope\\n(bottom left), and concentration of phosporus (bottom right).\\nWe are particularly interested in analyzing the locations of 3,604 Beilschmiedia\\npendula Lauraceae (BPL) tree stems. We model the intensity of BPL trees as a loglinear function of two topological attributes and 13 soil properties as the covariates.\\nFigure 2 contains maps of the locations of BPL trees, elevation, slope, and concentration of Phosporus. BPL trees seem to appear in greater abundance in the areas\\nof high elevation, steep slope, and low concentration of Phosporus. The covariates\\nmaps are depicted in Figure 4.\\nWe apply the regularized (un)weighted Poisson and the logistic likelihoods, combined with adaptive lasso regularization to select and estimate parameters. Since\\nwe do not deal with datasets which have very large number of points, we can set the\\ndefault number of dummy points for Poisson likelihood as in the spatstat package,\\ni.e. the number of dummy points can be chosen to be larger than the number of\\npoints, to perform quickly and efficiently. It is worth emphasizing that we center and\\nscale the 15 covariates to observe which one has the largest effect on the intensity.\\nThe results are presented in Table 10: 12 covariates for the Poisson likelihood and\\n11 for the logistic method are selected out of the 15 covariates using the unweighted\\nmethods while only 5 covariates (both for the Poisson and logistic methods) are\\nselected using the weighted versions. The unweighted methods tend to overfit the\\nmodel by overselecting unimportant covariates.\\nThe weighted methods tend to keep out the uninformative covariates. Both\\nPoisson and logistic estimates own similar selection and estimation results.

Second, we may loose some nonzero\\ncovariates when we apply the weighted methods, even though it is only for the\\ncovariates which have relatively small coefficient. Boron (B) has high correlation\\nwith many of the other covariates, particularly with those which are not selected.\\nThis is possibly why Boron, which is selected and may have nonnegligible coefficient\\nin the unweighted methods, is not chosen in the model. This may explain why the\\nweighted methods introduce extra biases. However, since the situation appears to\\nbe quite close to the scenario 3 from the simulation study, the weighted methods\\nare more favorable in terms of both selection and prediction.\\nIn this application, we do not face any computational problem. Nevertheless, if\\nwe have to model a species of trees with much more points, the default value for nd\\nwill lead to numerical problems. In such a case, the logistic likelihood would be a\\ngood alternative.\\nThese results suggest that BPL trees favor to live in areas of higher elevation\\n33\\n\\n\fand slope. This result is different from the findings by Waagepetersen (2007) and\\nGuan and Loh (2007) which concluded based on standard error estimation that BPL\\ntrees do not really prefer either high or low altitudes. However, we have the same\\nconclusion with the analysis by Guan and Shen (2010) and Thurman et al. (2015)\\nthat BPL trees prefer to live on higher altitudes. Further, higher levels of Manganese\\n(Mn) and lower levels of both Phosporus (P) and Zinc (Zn) concentrations in soil\\nare associated with higher appearance of BPL trees.\\n\\n9\\n\\nConclusion and discussion\\n\\nWe develop regularized versions of estimating equations based on Campbell theorem\\nderived from the Poisson and the logistic likelihoods. Our procedure is able to estimate intensity function of spatial point processes, when the intensity is a function\\nof many covariates and has a log-linear form. Furthermore, our procedure is also\\ngenerally easy to implement in R since we need to combine spatstat package with\\nglmnet and ncvreg packages. We study the asymptotic properties of both regularized weighted Poisson and logistic estimates in terms of consistency, sparsity, and\\nnormality distribution. We find that, among the regularization methods considered\\nin this paper, adaptive lasso, adaptive elastic net, SCAD, and MC+ are the methods\\nthat can satisfy our theorems.\\nWe carry out some scenarios in the simulation study to observe selection and\\nprediction properties of the estimates. We compare the penalized Poisson likelihood\\n(PL) and the penalized weighted Poisson likelihood (WPL) with different penalty\\nfunctions. From the results, when we deal with covariates having a complex covariance matrix and when the point pattern looks quite clustered, we recommend to\\napply the penalized WPL combined with adaptive lasso regularization. Otherwise,\\nthe regularized PL with adaptive lasso is more preferable. The further and more\\ncareful investigation to choose the tuning parameters may be needed to improve\\nthe selection properties. We note the bias increases quite significantly when the\\nregularized WPL is applied. When the penalized WPL is considered, a two-step\\nprocedure may be needed to improve the prediction properties: (1) use the penalized WPL combined with adaptive lasso to chose the covariates, then (2) use the\\nselected covariates to obtain the estimates. This post-selection inference procedure\\nhas not been investigated in this paper.\\nWe also compare the estimates obtained from the Poisson and the logistic likelihoods. When the number of dummy points can be chosen to be either similar to or\\nlarger than the number of points, we recommend the use of the Poisson likelihood\\nmethod. Nevertheless, when the number of dummy points should be chosen to be\\nsmaller than the number of points, the logistic method is more favorable.\\nA further work would consist in studying the situation when the number of the\\ncovariates is much larger than the sample size. In such a situation, the coordinate descent algorithm used in this paper may cause some numerical troubles. The\\nDantzig selector procedure introduced by Candes and Tao (2007) might be a good\\nalternative as the implementaion for linear models (and for generalized linear mod34\\n\\n\fels) results in a linear programming. It would be interesting to bring this approach\\nto spatial point process setting.\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank A. L.

I NTRODUCTION\\nRecent advances in wireless networking, sensing, computing, and control are revolutionizing how control systems\\ninteract with information and physical processes such as\\nCyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and\\nTactile Internet [1], [2], [3]. In Wireless Networked Control\\nSystems (WNCS), sensor nodes attached to the physical plant\\nsample and transmit their measurements to the controller over\\na wireless channel; controllers compute control commands\\nP.

Coleri Ergen contributed equally to this work.\\n\\nbased on these sensor data, which are then forwarded to the\\nactuators in order to influence the dynamics of the physical\\nplant [4], [5]. In particular, WNCS are strongly related to CPS\\nand Tactile Internet since these emerging techniques deal with\\nthe real-time control of physical systems over the networks.\\nThere is a strong technology push behind WNCS through\\nthe rise of embedded computing, wireless networks, advanced\\ncontrol, and cloud computing as well as a pull from emerging\\napplications in automotive [6], [7], avionics [8], building\\nmanagement [9], and industrial automation [10], [11]. For\\nexample, WNCS play a key role in Industry 4.0 [12]. The ease\\nof installation and maintenance, large flexibility, and increased\\nsafety make WNCS a fundamental infrastructure technology\\nfor safety-critical control systems. WNCS applications have\\nbeen backed up by several international organizations such as\\nWireless Avionics Intra-Communications Alliance [8], Zigbee\\nAlliance [13], Z-wave Alliance [14], International Society of\\nAutomation [15], Highway Addressable Remote Transducer\\ncommunication foundation [16], and Wireless Industrial Networking Alliance [17].\\nWNCS require novel design mechanisms to address the\\ninteraction between control and wireless systems for maximum\\noverall system performance and efficiency. Conventional control system design is based on the assumption of instantaneous\\ndelivery of sensor data and control commands with extremely\\nhigh reliabilities. The usage of wireless networks in the data\\ntransmission introduces non-zero delay and message error\\nprobability at all times. Transmission failures or deadline\\nmisses may result in the degradation of the control system\\nperformance, and even more serious economic losses or reduced human safety. Hence, control system design needs to\\ninclude mechanisms to tolerate message loss and delay. On\\nthe other hand, wireless network design needs to consider\\nthe strict delay and reliability constraints of control systems.\\nThe data transmissions should be sufficiently reliable and\\ndeterministic with the latency on the order of seconds, or even\\nmilliseconds, depending on the time constraints of the closedloop system [10], [11]. Furthermore, removing cables for the\\ndata communication of sensors and actuators motivates the\\nremoval of the power supply to these nodes to achieve full\\nflexibility. The limited stored battery or harvested energy of\\nthese components brings additional limitation on the energy\\nconsumption of the wireless network [18], [19], [20].\\nThe interaction between wireless networks and control\\nsystems can be illustrated by an example. A WNCS connects\\nsensors attached to a plant to a controller via the single-hop\\nwireless networking protocol IEEE 802.15.4.

The quadratic control cost is defined\\nas a sum of the deviations of the plant state from its desired\\nsetpoint and the magnitude of the control input. The maximum\\nallowable control cost is set to 6. The transparent region\\nindicates that the maximum allowable control cost or network\\nrequirements are not feasible. For instance, the control cost\\nwould be minimized when there is no message loss and no\\ndelay, but this point is infeasible since these requirements\\ncannot be met by the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol. The control cost\\ngenerally increases as the message loss probability, message\\ndelay, and sampling period increase. Since short sampling\\nperiods increase the traffic load, the message loss probability,\\nand the message delay are then closer to their critical values,\\nabove which the system is unstable [22]. Hence, the area\\nand shape of the feasible region significantly depends on the\\nnetwork performance. Determining the optimal parameters for\\nminimum network cost while achieving feasibility is not trivial\\nbecause of the complex interdependence of the control and\\ncommunication systems.\\nRecently, Lower-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) such\\nas Long-Range WAN (LoRa) [23] and NarrowBand IoT (NB-\\n\\nIoT) [24] are developed to enable IoT connections over\\nlong-ranges (10–15 km). Even though some related works\\nof WNCS are applicable for LPWAN-based control applications such as Smart Grid [25], Smart Transportation [26],\\nand Remote Healthcare [27], this survey focuses on wireless\\ncontrol systems based on Low-Power Wireless Personal Area\\nNetworks (LoWPAN) with short-range radios and their applications. Some recent excellent surveys exist on wireless\\nnetworks, particularly for industrial automation [28], [29],\\n[30]. Specifically, [28] discusses the general requirements and\\nrepresentative protocols of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\\nfor industrial applications. [29] compares popular industrial\\nWSN standards in terms of architecture and design. [30]\\nmainly elaborates on real-time scheduling algorithms and protocols for WirelessHART networks, experimentation and joint\\nwireless-control design approaches for industrial automation.\\nWhile [30] focused on WirelessHART networks and their control applications, this article provides a comprehensive survey\\nof the design space of wireless networks for control systems\\nand the potential synergy and interaction between control\\nand communication designs. Specifically, our survey touches\\non the importance of interactions between recent advanced\\nworks of NCS and WSN, as well as different approaches of\\nwireless network design and optimization for various WNCS\\napplications.\\nThe goal of this survey is to unveil and address the requirements and challenges associated with wireless network design\\nfor WNCS and present a review of recent advances in novel\\ndesign approaches, optimizations, algorithms, and protocols\\nfor effectively developing WNCS. The section structure and\\nrelations are illustrated in Fig. 2. Section II introduces some\\n\\n\f3\\n\\ninspiring applications of WNCS in automotive electronics,\\navionics, building automation, and industrial automation. Section III describes WNCS where multiple plants are remotely\\ncontrolled over a wireless network. Section IV presents the\\ncritical interactive variables of communication and control\\nsystems, including sampling period, message delay, message\\ndropout, and energy consumption. Section V introduces basic\\nwireless network standardization and key network parameters\\nat various protocol layers useful to tune the distribution of\\nthe critical interactive variables. Section VI then provides an\\noverview of recent control design methods incorporating the\\ninteractive variables. Section VII presents various optimization\\ntechniques for wireless networks integrating the control systems. We classify the design approaches into two categories\\nbased on the degree of the integration: interactive designs and\\njoint designs. In the interactive design, the wireless network\\nparameters are tuned to satisfy given requirements of the\\ncontrol system. In the joint design, the wireless network and\\ncontrol system parameters are jointly optimized considering\\nthe tradeoff between their performances. Section VIII describes three experimental testbeds of WNCS. We conclude\\nthis article by highlighting promising research directions in\\nSection IX.\\nII. M OTIVATING A PPLICATIONS\\nThis section explores some inspiring applications of WNCS.\\nA. Intra-Vehicle Wireless Network\\nIn-vehicle wireless networks have been recently proposed\\nwith the goal of reducing manufacturing and maintenance cost\\nof a large amount of wiring harnesses within vehicles [6], [7].\\nThe wiring harnesses used for the transmission of data and\\npower delivery within the current vehicle architecture may\\nhave up to 4 000 parts, weigh as much as 40 kg and contain up\\nto 4 km of wiring. Eliminating these wires would additionally\\nhave the potential to improve fuel efficiency, greenhouse gas\\nemission, and spur innovation by providing an open architecture to accommodate new systems and applications.\\nAn intra-vehicular wireless network consists of a central\\ncontrol unit, a battery, electronic control units, wireless sensors, and wireless actuators. Wireless sensor nodes send their\\ndata to the corresponding electronic control unit while scavenging energy from either one of the electronic control units or\\nenergy scavenging devices attached directly to them. Actuators\\nreceive their commands from the corresponding electronic\\ncontrol unit, and power from electronic control units or an\\nenergy scavenging device. The reason for incorporating energy\\nscavenging into the envisioned architecture is to eliminate the\\nlifetime limitation of fixed storage batteries.\\nThe applications that can exploit a wireless architecture\\nfall into one of three categories: powertrain, chassis, and\\nbody. Powertrain applications use automotive sensors in engine, transmission, and onboard diagnostics for control of\\nvehicle energy use, driveability, and performance. Chassis\\napplications control vehicle handling and safety in steering,\\nsuspension, braking, and stability elements of the vehicle.\\nBody applications include sensors mainly used for vehicle\\n\\noccupant needs such as occupant safety, security, comfort,\\nconvenience, and information. The first intra-vehicle wireless\\nnetwork applications are the Tire Pressure Monitoring System\\n(TPMS) [31] and Intelligent Tire [32]. TPMS is based on the\\nwireless transmission of tire pressure data from the in-tire\\nsensors to the vehicle body. It is currently being integrated\\ninto all new cars in both U.S.A and Europe. Intelligent Tire\\nis based on the placement of wireless sensors inside the tire\\nto transfer accelerometer data to the coordination nodes in the\\nbody of the car with the goal of improving the performance of\\nactive safety systems. Since accelerometer data are generated\\nat much higher rate than the pressure data and batteries cannot\\nbe placed within the tire, Intelligent Tire contains an ultralow power wireless communication system powered by energy\\nscavenging technology, which is now being commercialized by\\nPirelli [33].\\nB. Wireless Avionics Intra-Communication\\nWireless Avionics Intra-Communications (WAIC) have a\\ntremendous potential to improve an aircraft’s performance\\nthrough more cost-effective flight operations, reduction in\\noverall weight and maintenance costs, and enhancement of\\nthe safety [8]. Currently, the cable harness provides the connection between sensors and their corresponding control units\\nto sample and process sensor information, and then among\\nmultiple control units over a backbone network for the safetycritical flight control [8], [34]. Due to the high demands on\\nsafety and efficiency, the modern aircraft relies on a large\\nwired sensor and actuator networks that consist of more than\\n5 000 devices. Wiring harness usually represents 2–5% of an\\naircraft’s weight. For instance, the wiring harness of the Airbus\\nA350-900 weights 23 000 kg [35].\\nThe WAIC alliance considers wireless sensors of avionics located at various locations both within and outside the\\naircraft. The sensors are used to monitor the health of the\\naircraft structure, e.g., smoke sensors and ice detectors, and\\nits critical systems, e.g., engine sensors and landing gear\\nsensors. The sensor information is communicated to a central\\nonboard entity. Potential WAIC applications are categorized\\ninto two broad classes according to application data rate\\nrequirements [36]. Low and high data rate applications have\\ndata rates less than and above 10 kbit/s, respectively.\\nAt the World Radio Conference 2015, the International\\nTelecommunication Union voted to grant the frequency band\\n4.2–4.4 GHz for WAIC systems to allow the replacement of\\nthe heavy wiring used in aircraft [37]. The WAIC alliance is\\ndedicating efforts to the performance analysis of the assigned\\nfrequency band and the design of the wireless networks for\\navionics control systems [8]. Space shuttles and international\\nspace stations have already been using commercially available\\nwireless solutions such as EWB MicroTAU and UltraWIS of\\nInvocon [38].\\nC. Building Automation\\nWireless network based building automation provides significant savings in installation cost, allowing a large retrofit\\nmarket to be addressed as well as new constructions. Building\\n\\n\f4\\n\\nautomation aims to achieve optimal level occupant comfort\\nwhile minimizing energy usage [39]. These control systems\\nare the integrative component to fans, pumps, heating/cooling\\nequipment, dampers, and thermostats. The modern building\\ncontrol systems require a wide variety of sensing capabilities\\nin order to control temperature, pressure, humidity, and flow\\nrates. The European environment agency [40], [41] shows that\\nthe electricity and water consumption of buildings are about\\n30% and 43% of the total resource consumptions, respectively.\\nAn On World survey [42] reports that 59% of 600 early\\nadopters in five continents are interested in new technologies\\nthat will help them better manage their energy consumption,\\nand 81% are willing to pay for energy management equipment\\nif they could save up to 30% on their energy bill for smart\\nenergy home applications.\\nAn example of energy management systems using WSNs is\\nthe intelligent building ventilation control described in [9]. An\\nunderfloor air distribution indoor climate regulation process\\nis set with the injection of a fresh airflow from the floor\\nand an exhaust located at the ceiling level. The considered\\nsystem is composed of ventilated rooms, fans, plenums, and\\nwireless sensors. A well-designed underfloor air distribution\\nsystems can reduce the energy consumption of buildings\\nwhile improving the thermal comfort, ventilation efficiency\\nand indoor air quality by using the low-cost WSNs.\\nD. Industrial Automation\\nWireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) is an effective smart infrastructure for process control and factory automation [11], [43], [44]. Emerson Process Management [45]\\nestimates that WSNs enable cost savings of up to 90%\\ncompared to the deployment cost of wired field devices in\\nthe industrial automation domain. In industrial process control,\\nthe product is processed in a continuous manner (e.g., oil, gas,\\nchemicals). In factory automation or discrete manufacturing,\\ninstead, the products are processed in discrete steps with the\\nindividual elements (e.g., cars, drugs, food). Industrial wireless\\nsensors typically report the state of a fuse, heating, ventilation,\\nor vibration levels on pumps. Since the discrete product of\\nthe factory automation requires sophisticated operations of\\nrobot and belt conveyors at high speed, the sampling rates and\\nreal-time requirements are often stricter than those of process\\nautomation. Furthermore, many industrial automation applications might in the future require battery-operated networks of\\nhundreds of sensors and actuators communicating with access\\npoints.\\nAccording to TechNavio [46], WSN solutions in industrial\\ncontrol applications is one of the major emerging industrial\\ntrends. Many wireless networking standards have been proposed for industrial processes, e.g., WirelessHART by ABB,\\nEmerson, and Siemens and ISA 100.11a by Honeywell [47].\\nSome industrial wireless solutions are also commercially available and deployed such as Tropos of ABB and Smart Wireless\\nof Emerson.\\nIII.

Multiple plants are\\ncontrolled by multiple controllers. A wireless network closes the loop\\nfrom sensor to controller and from controller to actuator. The network\\nincludes not only nodes attached to the plant or controller, but also\\nrelay nodes.\\n\\nwireless network [48]. The wireless network includes sensors\\nand actuators attached to the plants, controllers, and relay\\nnodes. A plant is a continuous-time physical system to be\\ncontrolled. The inputs and outputs of the plant are continuoustime signals. Outputs of plant i are sampled at periodic or\\naperiodic intervals by the wireless sensors. Each packet associated to the state of the plant is transmitted to the controller\\nover a wireless network. When the controller receives the\\nmeasurements, it computes the control command. The control\\ncommands are then sent to the actuator attached to the plant.\\nHence, the closed-loop system contains both a continuous-time\\nand a sampled-data component. Since both sensor–controller\\nand controller–actuator channels use a wireless network, general WNCS of Fig. 3 are also called two-channel feedback\\nNCS [48]. The system scenario is quite general, as it applies\\nto any interconnection between a plant and a controller.\\nA. Control Systems\\nThe objective of the feedback control system is to ensure\\nthat the closed-loop system has desirable dynamic and steadystate response characteristics, and that it is able to efficiently\\nattenuate disturbances and handle network delays and loss.\\nGenerally, the closed-loop system should satisfy various design objectives: stability, fast and smooth responses to setpoint changes, elimination of steady-state errors, avoidance\\nof excessive control actions, and a satisfactory degree of\\nrobustness to process variations and model uncertainty [49].\\nIn particular, the stability of a control system is an extremely\\nimportant requirement. Most NCS design methods consider\\nsubsets of these requirements to synthesize the estimator and\\nthe controller. In this subsection, we briefly introduce some\\nfundamental aspects of modeling, stability, control cost, and\\ncontroller and estimator design for NCSs.\\n1) NCS Modeling: NCSs can be modeled using three main\\napproaches, namely, the discrete-time approach, the sampleddata approach, and the continuous-time approach, dependent\\non the controller and the plant [50]. The discrete-time approach considers discrete-time controllers and a discrete-time\\nplant model. The discrete-time representation leads often to\\nan uncertain discrete-time system in which the uncertainties\\nappear in the matrix exponential form due to discretization.\\n\\n\f5\\n\\nTypically, this approach is applied to NCS with linear plants\\nand controllers since in that case exact discrete-time models\\ncan be derived.\\nSecondly, the sampled-data approach considers discretetime controllers but for a continuous-time model that describes\\nthe sampled-data NCS dynamics without exploiting any form\\nof discretization [51]. Delay-differential equations can be used\\nto model the sampled-data dynamics. This approach is able to\\ndeal simultaneously with time-varying delays and time-varying\\nsampling intervals.\\nFinally, the continuous-time approach designs a continuoustime controller to stabilize a continuous-time plant model. The\\ncontinuous-time controller then needs to be approximated by\\na representation suitable for computer implementation [49],\\nwhereas typical WNCS consider the discrete-time controller.\\nWe will discuss more details of the analysis and design of\\nWNCS to deal with the network effects in Section VI.\\n2) Stability: Stability is a base requirement for controller\\ndesign. We briefly describe two fundamental notions of stability, namely, input-output stability and internal stability [52].\\nWhile the input-output stability is the ability of the system to\\nproduce a bounded output for any bounded input, the internal\\nstability is the system ability to return to equilibrium after a\\nperturbation. For linear systems, these two notions are closely\\nrelated, but for nonlinear system they are not the same.\\nInput-output stability concerns the forced response of\\nthe system for a bounded input. A system is defined to\\nbe Bounded-Input-Bounded-Output (BIBO) stable if every\\nbounded input to the system results in a bounded output. If\\nfor any bounded input the output is not bounded the system\\nis said to be unstable.\\nInternal stability is based on the magnitude of the system\\nresponse in steady state. If the steady-state response is unbounded, the system is said to be unstable. A system is said to\\nbe asymptotically stable if its response to any initial conditions\\ndecays to zero asymptotically in the steady state. A system\\nis defined to be exponentially stable if the system response\\nin addition decays exponentially towards zero. The faster\\nconvergence often means better performance. In fact, many\\nNCS researches analyze exponential stability conditions [53],\\n[54]. Furthermore, if the response due to the initial conditions\\nremains bounded but does not decay to zero, the system is\\nsaid to be marginally stable. Hence, a system cannot be both\\nasymptotically stable and marginally stable. If a linear system\\nis asymptotically stable, then it is BIBO stable. However,\\nBIBO stability does not generally imply internal stability.\\nInternal stability is stronger in some sense, because BIBO\\nstability can hide unstable internal behaviors, which do not\\nappear in the output.\\n3) Control Cost: Besides stability guarantees, typically a\\ncertain closed-loop control performance is desired. The closedloop performance of a control system can be quantified by the\\ncontrol cost as a function of plant state and control inputs [52].\\nA general regulation control goal is to keep the state error\\nfrom the setpoint close to zero, while minimizing the control\\nactions. Hence, the control cost often consists of two terms,\\nnamely, the deviations of plant state from their desired setpoint\\nand the magnitude of the control input. A common controller\\n\\ndesign approach is via a Linear Quadratic control formulation\\nfor linear systems and a quadratic cost function [55]. The\\nquadratic control cost is defined as a sum of the quadratic\\nfunctions of the state deviation and the control effort. In such\\nformulation, the optimal control policy that minimizes the cost\\nfunction can be explicitly computed from a Riccati equation.\\n4) Controller Design: The controller should ensure that the\\nclosed-loop system has desirable dynamic and steady state\\nresponse characteristics. For NCS, the network delay and loss\\nmay degrade the control performance and even destabilize the\\nsystem. Some surveys present controller design for NCSs [48],\\n[56]. For a historical review, see the survey [57]. We briefly\\ndescribe three representative controllers, namely, ProportionalIntegral-Derivative (PID) controller [58], Linear Quadratic\\nRegulator (LQR) control [55], and Model Predictive Control\\n(MPC) [59].\\nPID control is almost a century old and has remained the\\nmost widely used controller in process control until today [58].\\nOne of the main reasons for this controller to be so widely\\nused is that it can be designed without precise knowledge of\\nthe plant model. A PID controller calculates an error value\\nas the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured\\nplant state. The control signal is a sum of three terms: the Pterm (which is proportional to the error), the I-term (which is\\nproportional to the integral of the error), and the D-term (which\\nis proportional to the derivative of the error). The controller\\nparameters are proportional gain, integral time, and derivative\\ntime. The integral, proportional, and derivative part can be\\ninterpreted as control actions based on the past, the present\\nand the future of the plant state. Several parameter tuning\\nmethods for PID controllers exist [58], [60]. Historically, PID\\ntuning methods require a trial and error process in order to\\nachieve a desired stability and control performance.\\nThe linear quadratic problem is one of the most fundamental\\noptimal control problems where the objective is to minimize a\\nquadratic cost function subject to plant dynamics described by\\na set of linear differential equations [55]. The quadratic cost is\\na sum of the plant state cost, final state cost, and control input\\ncost. The optimal controller is a linear feedback controller.\\nThe LQR algorithm is basically an automated way to find\\nthe state-feedback controller. Furthermore, the LQR is an important subproblem of the general Linear Quadratic Gaussian\\n(LQG) problem. The LQG problem deals with uncertain linear\\nsystems disturbed by additive Gaussian noise. While the LQR\\nproblem assumes no noise and full state observation, the LQG\\nproblem considers input and measurement noise and partial\\nstate observation.\\nFinally, MPC solves an optimal linear quadratic control\\nproblems over a receding horizon [59]. Hence, the optimization problem is similar to the controller design problem of\\nLQR but solved over a moving horizon in order to handle\\nmodel uncertainties. In contrast to non-predictive controllers,\\nsuch as a PID or a LQR controller, which compute the\\ncurrent control action as a function of the current plant state\\nusing the information about the plant from the past, predictive\\ncontrollers compute the control based on the systems predicted\\nfuture behaviour [61]. MPC tries to optimize the system\\nbehaviour in a receding horizon fashion.

Sampling Period\\n1) Control System Aspect: Continuous-time signals of the\\nplant need to be sampled before they are transmitted through\\na wireless network. It is important to note that the choice of\\nthe sampling should be related to the desired properties of the\\nclosed-loop system such as the response to reference signals,\\ninfluence of disturbances, network traffic, and computational\\nload [74]. There are two methods to sample continuoustime signals in WNCS: time-triggered and event-triggered\\nsampling [75].\\nIn time-triggered sampling, the next sampling instant occurs\\nafter the elapse of a fixed time interval, regardless of the\\nplant state. Periodic sampling is widely used in digital control\\nsystems due to the simple analysis and design of such systems.\\nBased on experience and simulations, a common rule for the\\nselection of the sampling period is to make sure ω h be in the\\nrange [0.1, 0.6] , where ω is the desired natural frequency of\\nthe closed-loop system and h is the sampling period [74]. This\\nimplies typically that we are sampling up to 20 samples per\\nperiod of the dominating mode of the closed-loop system.\\nIn a traditional digital control system based on point-topoint wired connections, the smaller the sampling period is\\nchosen, the better the performance is achieved for the control\\nsystem [76]. However, in wireless networks, the decrease in\\nsampling period increases the network traffic, which in turn\\nincreases the message loss probability and message delay.\\nTherefore, the decrease in sampling period eventually degrades\\nthe control performance, as illustrated in Fig. 1.\\nRecently, event-based control schemes such event- and\\nself-triggered control systems have been proposed, where\\n\\nsensing and actuating are performed when the system needs\\nattention [75]. Hence, the traffic pattern of event- and selftriggered control systems is asynchronous rather than periodic.\\nIn event-triggered control, the execution of control tasks is\\ndetermined by the occurrence of an event rather than the\\nelapse of a fixed time period as in time-triggered control.\\nEvents are triggered only when stability or a pre-specified\\ncontrol performance are about to be lost [77], [78], [79].\\nEvent-triggered control can significantly reduce the traffic\\nload of the network with no or minor control performance\\ndegradation since the traffic is generated only if the signal\\nchanges by a specified amount [80], [81]. However, since most\\ntrigger conditions depend on the instantaneous state, the plant\\nstate is required to be monitored [77], [79]. Self-triggered\\ncontrol has been proposed to prevent such monitoring [82].\\nIn self-triggered control, an estimation of the next event time\\ninstant is made. The online detection of plant disturbances and\\ncorresponding control actions cannot be generated with selftriggered control. A combination of event- and self-triggered\\ncontrol is therefore often desirable [81], [83].\\n2) Communication System Aspect: The choice of timetriggered and event-triggered sampling in the control system\\ndetermines the pattern of message generation in the wireless\\nnetwork. Time-triggered sampling results in regular periodic\\nmessage generation at predetermined rate. If random medium\\naccess mechanism is used, the increase in network load results\\nin worse performance in the other critical interactive system\\nvariables, i.e., message delay, message dropout, and energy\\nconsumption [84]. The increase in control system performance\\nwith higher sampling rates, therefore, does not hold due to\\nthese network effects. On the other hand, the predetermined\\nnature of packet transmissions in time-triggered sampling\\nallows explicit scheduling of sensor node transmissions before-\\n\\n\f8\\n\\nhand, reducing the message loss and delay caused by random\\nmedium access [85], [86]. A scheduled access mechanism can\\npredetermine the transmission time of all the components such\\nthat additional nodes have minimal effect on the transmission\\nof existing nodes [6], [87]. When the transmission of the\\nperiodically transmitting nodes are distributed uniformly over\\ntime rather than being allocated immediately as they arrive,\\nadditional nodes may be allocated without causing any jitter\\nin their periodic allocation.\\nThe optimal choice of medium access control mechanism\\nis not trivial for event-triggered control [81], [88]. The overall\\nperformance of event-triggered control systems significantly\\ndepends on the plant dynamics and the number of control\\nloops. The random access mechanism is a good alternative if\\na large number of slow dynamical plants share the wireless\\nnetwork. In this case, the scheduled access mechanism may\\nresult in significant delay between the triggering of an event\\nand a transmission in its assigned slot due to the large number\\nof control loops. However, most time slots are not utilized\\nsince the traffic load is low for slow plants. On the other hand,\\nthe scheduled access mechanism performs well when a small\\nnumber of the fast plants is controlled by the event-triggered\\ncontrol algorithm. Contention-based random access generally\\ndegrades the reliability and delay performance for the high\\ntraffic load of fast plants. When there are packet losses in\\nthe random access scheme, the event-triggered control further\\nincreases the traffic load, which may eventually incur stability\\nproblems [88].\\nThe possible event-time prediction of self-triggered control\\nalleviates the high network load problem of time-triggered\\nsampling and random message generation nature of eventtriggered sampling by predicting the evolution of the triggering\\nthreshold crossings of the plant state [75]. The prediction\\nallows the explicit scheduling of sensor node transmissions,\\neliminating the high message delays and losses of random\\nmedium access. Most existing works of event-triggered and\\nself-triggered control assume that message dropouts and message disorders do not occur. This assumption is not practical\\nwhen the packets of messages are transmitted through a\\nwireless network. Dealing with message dropouts and message\\ndisorders in these control schemes is challenging for both the\\nwireless network and the control system.\\nB. Message Delay\\n1) Control System Aspect: There are mainly two kinds\\nof message delays of NCSs: sensor–controller delay and\\ncontroller–actuator delay, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The sensor–\\ncontroller delay represents the time interval from the instant\\nwhen the physical plant is sampled to the instant when the\\ncontroller receives the sampled message; and the controller–\\nactuator delay indicates the time duration from the generation\\nof the control message at the controller until its reception\\nat the actuator. The increase in both delays prevents the\\ntimely delivery of the control feedback, which degrades system\\nperformance, as exemplified in Fig. 1. In control theory, these\\ndelays cause phase shifts that limit the control bandwidth and\\naffect closed-loop stability [74].\\n\\nSince delays are especially pernicious for closed-loop systems, some forms of modeling and prediction are essential to overcome their effects. Techniques proposed to overcome sensor–controller delays use predictive filters including\\nKalman filter [74], [89], [64], [65]. In practice, message delay\\ncan be estimated from time stamped data if the receiving node\\nis synchronized through the wireless network [15], [16]. The\\ncontrol algorithm compensates the measured or predicted delay unless it is too large [89]. Such compensation is generally\\nimpossible for controller–actuator delays. Hence, controller–\\nactuator delays are more critical than the sensor–controller\\ndelays [22], [48].\\nThe packet delay variation is another interesting metric since\\nit significantly affects the control performance and causes\\npossible instability even when the mean delay is small. In\\nparticular, a heavy tail of the delay distribution significantly\\ndegrades the stability of the closed-loop system [90]. The\\namount of degradation depends on the dynamics of the process\\nand the distribution of the delay variations. One way to\\neliminate delay variations is to use a buffer, trading delay for\\nits variation.\\n2) Communication System Aspect: Message delay in a\\nmultihop wireless network consists of transmission delay,\\naccess delay, and queueing delay at each hop in the path from\\nthe source to the destination.\\nTransmission delay is defined as the time required for the\\ntransmission of the packet. Transmission delay depends on\\nthe amount of data to be transmitted to the destination and\\nthe transmission rate, which depends on the transmit power\\nof the node itself and its simultaneously active neighboring\\nnodes. As the transmit power of the node increases, its own\\ntransmission rate increases, decreasing its own transmission\\ndelay; while causing more interference to simultaneously\\ntransmitting nodes, increasing their delay. The optimization\\nof transmission power and rate should take into account this\\ntradeoff [91].\\nMedium access delay is defined as the time duration required to start the actual transmission of the packet. Access delay depends on the choice of medium access control\\n(MAC) protocol. If contention-based random access mechanism is used, this delay depends on the network load, encoding/decoding mechanism used in the transmitter and receiver,\\nand random access control protocol. As the network load increases, the access delay increases due to the increase in either\\nbusy sensed channel or failed transmissions. The receiver decoding capability determines the number of simultaneously active neighboring transmitters. The decoding technique may be\\nbased on interference avoidance, in which only one packet can\\nbe received at a time [91]; self-interference cancellation, where\\nthe node can transmit another packet while receiving [92]; or\\ninterference cancellation, where the node may receive multiple\\npackets simultaneously and eliminate interference [93]. Similarly, a transmitter may have the capability to transmit multiple\\npackets simultaneously [94]. The execution of the random\\naccess algorithm together with its parameters also affect the\\nmessage delay. On the other hand, if schedule-based access is\\nused, the access delay in general increases as the network load\\nincreases. However, this effect may be minimized by designing\\n\\n\f9\\n\\nefficient scheduling algorithms adopting uniform distribution\\nof transmissions via exploiting the periodic transmission of\\ntime-triggered control [6], [87]. Similar to random access,\\nmore advanced encoding/decoding capability of the nodes may\\nfurther decrease this access delay. Moreover, packet losses\\nover the channel may require retransmissions, necessitating\\nthe repetition of medium access and transmission delay over\\ntime. This further increases message delay, as illustrated in\\nFig. 4.\\nQueueing delay depends on the message generation rate at\\nthe nodes and amount of data they are relaying in the multihop\\nrouting path. The message generation and forwarding rate at\\nthe nodes should be kept at an acceptable level so as not\\nto allow packet build up at the queue. Moreover, scheduling\\nalgorithms should consider the multihop forwarding in order\\nto minimize the end-to-end delay from the source to the\\ndestination [66], [86], [95]. The destination may observe disordered messages since the packet associated to the message\\ntravels several hops with multiple routing paths or experiences\\nnetwork congestion [15], [96].\\nC. Message Dropout\\n1) Control System Aspect: Generally, there are two main\\nreasons for message dropouts, namely, message discard due to\\nthe control algorithm and message loss due to the wireless network itself. The logical Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) mechanism\\nis one of the most popular and simplest approaches to discard\\ndisordered messages [48], [97], [98]. In this mechanism, the\\nlatest message is kept and old messages are discarded based on\\nthe time stamp of the messages. However, some alternatives\\nare also proposed to utilize the disordered messages in a filter\\nbank [99], [100]. A message is considered to be lost if all\\npacket transmissions associated to the message have eventually\\nfailed. The effect of message dropouts is more critical than\\nmessage delay since it increases the updating interval with a\\nmultiple of the sampling period.\\nThere are mainly two types of dropouts: sensor–controller\\nmessage dropouts and controller–actuator message dropouts.\\nThe controller estimates the plant state to compensate possible\\nmessage dropouts of the sensor–controller channel. Remind\\nthat Kalman filtering is one of the most popular approaches\\nto estimate the plant state and works well if there is no\\nsignificant message loss [22]. Since the control command\\ndirectly affects the plant, controller–actuator dropouts are\\nmore critical than sensor–controller dropouts [101], [102].\\nMany practical NCSs have several sensor–controller channels\\nwhereas the controllers are collocated with the actuators, e.g.,\\nheat, ventilation and air-conditioning control systems [103].\\nNCS literatures often model the message dropout as a\\nstochastic variable based on different assumptions of the maximum consecutive message dropouts. In particular, significant\\nwork has been devoted for deriving upper bounds on the\\nupdating interval for which stability can be guaranteed [104],\\n[53], [105]. The upper bounds could be used as the update\\ndeadline over the network as we will discuss in more detail\\nin Section VI. The bursty message dropout is very critical for\\ncontrol systems since it directly affects the upper bounds on\\nthe updating interval.\\n\\n2) Communication System Aspect: Data packets may be\\nlost during their transmissions, due to the susceptibility of\\nwireless channel to blockage, multipath, doppler shift, and\\ninterference [106]. Obstructions between transmitter and receiver, and their variation over time, cause random variations\\nin the received signal, called shadow fading. The probabilistic\\ndistribution of the shadow fading depends on the number,\\nsize, and material of the obstructions in the environment.\\nMultipath fading, mainly caused by the multipath components\\nof the transmitted signal reflected, diffracted or scattered\\nby surrounding objects, occurs over shorter time periods or\\ndistances than shadow fading. The multipath components\\narriving at the receiver cause constructive and destructive\\ninterference, changing rapidly over distance. Doppler shift\\ndue to the relative motion between the transmitter and the\\nreceiver may cause the signal to decorrelate over time or\\nimpose lower bound on the channel error rate. Furthermore,\\nunintentional interference from the simultaneous transmissions\\nof neighboring nodes and intentional interference in the form\\nof cyber-attacks can disturb the successful reception of packets\\nas well.\\nD. Network Energy Consumption\\nA truly wireless solution for WNCS requires removing\\npower cables in addition to the data cables to provide full flexibility of installation and maintenance. Therefore, the nodes\\nneed to rely on either battery storage or energy harvesting\\ntechniques. Limiting the energy consumption in the wireless\\nnetwork prolongs the lifetime of the nodes. If enough energy\\nscavenging can be extracted from natural sources, inductive or\\nmagnetic resonant coupling, or radio frequency, then infinite\\nlifetime may be achieved [71], [73].\\nDecreasing sampling period, message delay, and message\\ndropout improves the performance of the control system, but at\\nthe cost of higher energy consumption in the communication\\nsystem [107]. The higher the sampling rate, the greater the\\nnumber of packets to be transmitted over the channel. This\\nincreases the energy consumption of the nodes. Moreover,\\ndecreasing message delay requires increasing the transmission\\nrate or data encoding/decoding capability at the transceivers.\\nThis again comes at the cost of increased energy consumption [108]. Finally, decreasing message dropout requires either\\nincreasing transmit power to combat fading and interference,\\nor increasing data encoding/decoding capabilities. This again\\ntranslates into energy consumption.\\nV. W IRELESS N ETWORK\\nA.

IEEE 802.15.4 is originally developed for lowrate, low-power and low-cost Personal Area Networks (PANs)\\nwithout any concern on delay and reliability. The standards\\nsuch as WirelessHART, ISA-100.11a and IEEE 802.15.4e are\\nbuilt on top of the physical layer of IEEE 802.15.4 with\\nadditional Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), frequency\\nhopping and multiple path features to provide delay and\\nreliable packet transmission guarantees while further lowering\\nenergy consumption.

In particular, the IEEE 802.11e specification amendment introduces significant enhancements to support the soft\\nreal-time applications. In this subsection, we will describe\\nthe fundamental operations of basic IEEE 802.11 and IEEE\\n802.11e. The standards are summarized in Table I.\\n1) IEEE 802.15.4: IEEE 802.15.4 standard defines the\\nphysical and MAC layers of the protocol stack [112]. A PAN\\nconsists of a PAN coordinator that is responsible of managing\\nthe network and many associated nodes. The standard supports both star topology, in which all the associated nodes\\ndirectly communicate with the PAN coordinator, and peer-topeer topology, where the nodes can communicate with any\\nneighbouring node while still being managed by the PAN\\ncoordinator.\\nThe physical layer adopts direct sequence spread spectrum,\\nwhich is based on spreading the transmitted signal over a\\nlarge bandwidth to enable greater resistance to interference.\\nA single channel between 868 and 868.6 MHz, 10 channels\\nbetween 902.0 and 928.0 MHz, and 16 channels between 2.4\\nand 2.4835 GHz are used. The transmission data rate is 250\\nkbps in the 2.4 GHz band, 40 kbps in 915 MHz and 20 kbps\\nin 868 MHz band.\\nThe standard defines two channel access modalities: the\\nbeacon enabled modality, which uses a slotted CSMA/CA and\\nthe optional Guaranteed Time Slot (GTS) allocation mechanism, and a simpler unslotted CSMA/CA without beacons.\\nThe communication is organized in temporal windows denoted\\nsuperframes.

The coordinator\\nand nodes can communicate during the active period, called\\nthe superframe duration TSD , and enter the low-power mode\\nduring the inactive period. The structure of the superframe is\\ndefined by two parameters, the beacon order (BO) and the\\nsuperframe order (SO), which determine the length of the\\nsuperframe and its active period, given by\\nTBI = aBaseSuperframeDuration × 2BO ,\\nTSD = aBaseSuperframeDuration × 2\\n\\nSO\\n\\n,\\n\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n\\nrespectively, where 0 ≤ SO ≤ BO ≤ 14 and\\naBaseSuperframeDuration is the number of symbols forming a\\nsuperframe when SO is equal to 0. In addition, the superframe\\nis divided into 16 equally sized superframe slots of length\\naBaseSlotDuration. Each active period can be further divided\\ninto a Contention Access Period (CAP) and an optional\\nContention Free Period (CFP), composed of GTSs. A slotted\\nCSMA/CA mechanism is used to access the channel of non\\ntime-critical data frames and GTS requests during the CAP. In\\nthe CFP, the dedicated bandwidth is used for time-critical data\\nframes. Fig. 7 illustrates the date transfer mechanism of the\\nbeacon enabled mode for the CAP and CFP.

The frequency hopping pattern is not explicitly defined in the standard but needs\\nto be determined by the network manager and distributed to\\nthe nodes. Channel blacklisting may also be used to eliminate\\nthe channels containing high interference levels. The network\\nmanager performs the blacklisting based on the quality of\\nreception at different channels in the network.\\nWirelessHART defines two primary routing approaches for\\nmultihop networks: source routing and graph routing. Source\\nrouting provides a single route of each flow, while graph\\nrouting provides multiple redundant routes [113]. Since the\\nsource routing approach only establishes a fixed single path\\nbetween source and destination, any link or node failure\\ndisturbs the end-to-end communication. For this reason, source\\nrouting is mostly used for network diagnostics purposes to\\ntest the end-to-end connection. Multiple redundant routes in\\nthe graph routing provide significant improvement over source\\nrouting in terms of the routing reliability. The routing paths\\nare determined by the network manager based on the periodic\\nreports received from the nodes including the historical and\\ninstantaneous quality of the wireless links.\\n3) ISA-100.11a: ISA-100.11a standard was released in\\nSeptember 2009 with many similar features to WirelessHART\\nbut providing more flexibility and adaptivity [15]. Similar\\nto WirelessHART, the standard adopts the IEEE 802.15.4\\nphysical layer on channels 11–25 at 2.4 GHz but with the\\noptional additional usage of channel 26. TDMA is again used\\nfor better energy consumption and reliability performance but\\nwith a configurable slot size on a superframe base.\\nISA-100.11a adopts channel hopping and blacklisting mech-\\n\\n\f12\\n\\nanism to improve the communication robustness similar to\\nWirelessHART but with more flexibility. The standard adopts\\nthree channel hopping mechanisms: slotted hopping, slow\\nhopping, and hybrid hopping. In slotted hopping, the channel\\nis varied in each slot, same as WirelessHART. In slow hopping,\\nthe node stays on the same channel for consecutive time\\nslots, a number which is configurable. Slow hopping facilitates\\nthe communication of nodes with imprecise synchronization,\\njoin process of new nodes, and transmission of event-driven\\npackets. Transmissions in a slow hopping period is performed\\nby using CSMA/CA. This mechanism decreases the delay of\\nevent-based packets while increasing energy consumption due\\nto unscheduled transmission and reception times. In hybrid\\nhopping, slotted hopping is combined with slow hopping by\\naccommodating slotted hopping for periodical messages and\\nslow hopping for less predictable new or event-driven messages. There are five predetermined channel hopping patterns\\nin this standard, in contrast to WirelessHART that does not\\nexplicitly define hopping patterns.\\n4) IEEE 802.15.4e: This standard has been released in\\n2012 with the goal of introducing new access modes to address\\nthe delay and reliability constraints of industrial applications [114]. IEEE 802.15.4e defines three major MAC modes,\\nnamely, Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH), Deterministic\\nand Synchronous Multichannel Extension (DSME), and Low\\nLatency Deterministic Network (LLDN).\\nTime Slotted Channel Hopping: TSCH is a medium access\\nprotocol based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for industrial\\nautomation and process control [115]. The main idea of\\nTSCH is to combine the benefits of time slotted access with\\nmultichannel and channel hopping capabilities. Time slotted\\naccess increases the network throughput by scheduling the\\ncollision-free links to meet the traffic demands of all nodes.\\nMultichannel allows more nodes to exchange their packets at\\nthe same time by using different channel offsets. Since TSCH\\nis based on the scheduling of TDMA slot and FDMA, the\\ndelay is deterministically bounded depending on the timefrequency pattern. Furthermore, the packet based frequency\\nhopping is supported to achieve a high robustness against interference and other channel impairments. TSCH also supports\\nvarious network topologies, including star, tree, and mesh.\\nTSCH mode exhibits many similarities to WirelessHART and\\nISA-100.11a, including slotted access, multichannel communication, and frequency hopping for mesh networks. In fact,\\nit defines more details of the MAC operation with respect to\\nWirelessHART and ISA-100.11a.\\nIn the TSCH mode, nodes synchronize on a periodic slotframe consisting of a number of time slots. Each node obtains\\nsynchronization, channel hopping, time slot and slotframe information from Enhanced Beacons (EBs) that are periodically\\nsent by other nodes in order to advertise the network. The\\nslots may be dedicated to one link or shared among links.\\nA dedicated link is defined as the pairwise assignment of a\\ndirected communication between nodes in a given time slot on\\na given channel offset. Hence, a link between communicating\\nnodes can be represented by a pair specifying the time slot in\\nthe slotframe and the channel offset used by the nodes in that\\ntime slot. However, the TSCH standard does not specify how\\n\\nto derive an appropriate link schedule.\\nSince collisions may occur in shared slots, the exponential\\nbackoff algorithm is used to retransmit the packet in the case\\nof a transmission failure to avoid repeated collisions. Differently from the original IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA algorithm,\\nthe backoff mechanism is activated only after a collision is\\nexperienced rather than waiting for a random backoff time\\nbefore the transmission.\\nDeterministic and Synchronous Multichannel Extension:\\nDSME is designed to support stringent timeliness and reliability requirements of factory automation, home automation,\\nsmart metering, smart buildings and patient monitoring [114].\\nDSME extends the beacon enabled mode of the IEEE 802.15.4\\nstandard, relying on the superframe structure, consisting of\\nCAPs and CFPs, by increasing the number of GTS time slots\\nand frequency channels used [112]. The channel access of\\nDSME relies on a specific structure called multi-superframe.\\nEach multi-superframe consists of a collection of superframes\\ndefined in IEEE 802.15.4. The beacon transmission interval\\nis a multiple number of multi-superframes without inactive\\nperiod. By adopting a multi-superframe structure, DSME tries\\nto support both periodic and aperiodic (or event-driven) traffic,\\neven in large multihop networks.\\nIn a DSME network, some coordinators periodically transmit an EB, used to keep all the nodes synchronized and\\nallow new nodes to join the network. The distributed beacon\\nand GTS scheduling algorithms of DSME allow to quickly\\nreact to time-varying traffic and changes in the network\\ntopology. Specifically, DSME allows to establish dedicated\\nlinks between any two nodes of the network for the multihop\\nmesh networks with deterministic delay. DSME is scalable\\nand does not suffer from a single point of failure because\\nbeacon scheduling and slot allocation are performed in a\\ndistributed manner. This is the major difference with TSCH,\\nwhich relies on a central entity. Given the large variety of\\noptions and features, DSME turns out to be one of the\\nmost complex modes of the IEEE 802.15.4e standard. Due\\nto the major complexity issue, DSME still lacks a complete\\nimplementation. Moreover, all the current studies on DSME\\nare limited to single-hop or cluster-tree networks, and do not\\ninvestigate the potentialities of mesh topologies.\\nLow Latency Deterministic Network: LLDN is designed\\nfor very low latency applications of the industrial automation\\nwhere a large number of devices sense and actuate the factory\\nproduction in a specific location [116]. Differently from TSCH\\nand DSME, LLDN is designed only for star topologies, where\\na number of nodes need to periodically send data to a central\\nsink using just one channel frequency. Specifically, the design\\ntarget of LLDN is to support the data transmissions from 20\\nsensor nodes every 10 ms. Since the former IEEE 802.15.4\\nstandard does not fulfill this constraint, the LLDN mode\\ndefines a fine granular deterministic TDMA access. Similarly\\nto IEEE 802.15.4, each LLDN device can obtain the exclusive\\naccess for a time slot in the superframe to send data to the\\nPAN coordinator. The number of time slots in a superframe\\ndetermines how many nodes can access the channel. If many\\nnodes need to send their packets, the PAN coordinator needs to\\nequip with multiple transceivers, so as to allow simultaneous\\n\\n\f13\\n\\ncommunications on different channels.\\nIn LLDN, short MAC frames with just a 1-octet MAC\\nheader are used to accelerate frame processing and reduce\\ntransmission time. Moreover, a node can omit the address\\nfields in the header, since all packets are destined to the PAN\\ncoordinator. Compared with TSCH, LLDN nodes do not need\\nto wait after the beginning of the time slot in order to start\\ntransmitting. Moreover, LLDN provides a group ACK feature.\\nHence, time slots can be much shorter than the one of TSCH,\\nsince it is not necessary to accommodate waiting times and\\nACK frames.\\n5) 6LoWPAN: 6LoWPAN provides a compaction and fragmentation mechanism to efficiently transport IPv6 packets in\\nIEEE 802.15.4 frames [109]. The IPv6 header is compressed\\nby the removal of the fields that are not needed or always\\nhave the same contents, and inferring IPv6 addresses from\\nlink layer addresses. Moreover, fragmentation rules are defined\\nso that multiple IEEE 802.15.4 frames can form one IPv6\\npacket. 6LoWPAN allows low-power devices to communicate\\nby using IP.\\n6) RPL: RPL is an IPv6 routing protocol for Low-Power\\nand Lossy Networks (LLNs) proposed to meet the delay, reliability and high availability requirements of critical applications\\nin industrial and environmental monitoring [117]. RPL is a\\ndistance vector and source routing protocol. It can operate\\non top of any link layer mechanism including IEEE 802.15.4\\nPHY and MAC. RPL adopts Destination Oriented Directed\\nAcyclic Graphs (DODAGs), where most popular destination\\nnodes act as the roots of the directed acyclic graphs. Directed\\nacyclic graphs are tree-like structures that allow the nodes\\nto associate with multiple parent nodes. The selection of the\\nstable set of parents for each node is based on the objective\\nfunction. The objective function determines the translation of\\nrouting metrics, such as delay, link quality and connectivity,\\ninto ranks, where the rank is defined as an integer, strictly\\ndecreasing in the downlink direction from the root. RPL left\\nthe routing metric open to the implementation [118].\\n7) 6TiSCH: 6TiSCH integrates an Internet-enabled IPv6based upper stack, including 6LoWPAN, RPL and IEEE\\n802.15.4 TSCH link layer [119]. This integration allows\\nachieving industrial performance in terms of reliability and\\npower consumption while providing an IP-enabled upper\\nstack. 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top) is used to manage TSCH schedule by allocating and deallocating resources\\nwithin the schedule, monitor performance and collect statistics.\\n6top uses either centralized or distributed scheduling. In\\ncentralized scheduling, an entity in the network collects topology and traffic requirements of the nodes in the network,\\ncomputes the schedule and then sends the schedule to the\\nnodes in the network. In distributed scheduling, nodes communicate with each other to compute their own schedule\\nbased on the local topology information. 6top labels the\\nscheduled cells as either hard or soft depending on their\\ndynamic reallocation capability. A hard cell is scheduled by\\nthe centralized entity and can be moved or deleted inside the\\nTSCH schedule only by that entity. 6top maintains statistics\\nabout the network performance in the scheduled cells. This\\ninformation is then used by the centralized scheduling entity to\\n\\nupdate the schedule as needed. Moreover, this information can\\nbe used in the objective function of RPL. On the other hand,\\na soft cell is typically scheduled by a distributed scheduling\\nentity. If a cell performs significantly worse than other cells\\nscheduled to the same neighbor, it is reallocated, providing\\nan interference avoidance mechanism in the network. The\\ndistributed scheduling policy, called on-the-fly scheduling,\\nspecifies the structure and interfaces of the scheduling [120].\\nIf the outgoing packet queue of a node fills up, the onthe-fly scheduling negotiates additional time slots with the\\ncorresponding neighbors. If the queue is empty, it negotiates\\nthe removal of the time slots.\\n8) IEEE 802.11: The basic 802.11 MAC layer uses the\\nDistributed Coordination Function (DCF) with a simple and\\nflexible exponential backoff based CSMA/CA and optional\\nRTS/CTS for medium sharing [121]. If the medium is sensed\\nidle, the transmitting node transmits its frame. Otherwise, it\\npostpones its transmission until the medium is sensed free\\nfor a time interval equal to the sum of an Arbitration InterFrame Spacing (AIFS) and a random backoff interval. DCF\\nexperiences a random and unpredictable backoff delay. As\\na result, the periodic real-time NCS packets may miss their\\ndeadlines due to the long backoff delay, particularly under\\ncongested network conditions.\\nTo enforce a timeliness behavior for WLANs, the original\\n802.11 MAC defines another coordination function called the\\nPoint Coordination Function (PCF). This is available only\\nin infrastructure mode, where nodes are connected to the\\nnetwork through an Access Point (AP). APs send beacon\\nframes at regular intervals. Between these beacon frames, PCF\\ndefines two periods: the Contention Free Period (CFP) and the\\nContention Period (CP). While DCF is used for the CP, in the\\nCFP, the AP sends contention-free-poll packets to give them\\nthe right to send a packet. Hence, each node has an opportunity\\nto transmit frames during the CFP. In PCF, data exchange\\nis based on a periodically repeated cycle (e.g., superframe)\\nwithin which time slots are defined and exclusively assigned to\\nnodes for transmission. PCF does not provide differentiation\\nbetween traffic types, and thus does not fulfill the deadline\\nrequirements for the real-time control systems. Furthermore,\\nthis mode is optional and is not widely implemented in WLAN\\ndevices.\\n9) IEEE 802.11e: As an extension of the basic DCF\\nmechanism of 802.11, the 802.11e enhances the DCF and the\\nPCF by using a new coordination function called the Hybrid\\nCoordination Function (HCF) [122]. Similar to those defined\\nin the legacy 802.11 MAC, there are two methods of channel accesses, namely, Enhanced Distributed Channel Access\\n(EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) within\\nthe HCF. Both EDCA and HCCA define traffic categories to\\nsupport various QoS requirements.\\nThe IEEE 802.11e EDCA provides differentiated access to\\nindividual traffic known as Access Categories (ACs) at the\\nMAC layer. Each node with high priority traffic basically waits\\na little less before it sends its packet than a node with low\\npriority traffic. This is accomplished through the variation\\nof CSMA/CA using a shorter AIFS and contention window\\nrange for higher priority packets. Considering the real-time\\n\\n\f14\\n\\nrequirements of NCSs, the periodic NCS traffic should be\\ndefined as an AC with a high priority [123] and saturation\\nmust be avoided for high priority ACs [124].\\nHCCA extends PCF by supporting parametric traffic and\\ncomes close to actual transmission scheduling. Both PCF\\nand HCCA enable contention-free access to support collisionfree and time-bounded transmissions. In contrast to PCF, the\\nHCCA allows for CFPs being initiated at almost anytime to\\nsupport QoS differentiation. The coordinator drives the data\\nexchanges at runtime according to specific rules, depending\\non the QoS of the traffic demands. Although HCCA is quite\\nappealing, like PCF, HCCA is also not widely implemented\\nin network equipment. Hence, some researches adapt the\\nDCF and EDCA mechanisms for practical real-time control\\napplications [125], [126], [127], [128].\\nB. Wireless Network Parameters\\nTo fulfill the control system requirements, the bandwidth of\\nthe wireless networks needs to be allocated to high priority\\ndata for sensing and actuating with specific deadline requirements. However, existing QoS-enabled wireless standards do\\nnot explicitly consider the deadline requirements and thus\\nlead to unpredictable performance of WNCS [129], [125].\\nThe wireless network parameters determine the probability\\ndistribution of the critical interactive system variables. Some\\ndesign parameters of different layers are the transmission\\npower and rate of the nodes, the decoding capability of the\\nreceiver at the physical layer, the protocol for channel access\\nand energy saving mechanism at the MAC layer, and the\\nprotocol for packet forwarding at the routing layer.\\n1) Physical Layer: The physical layer parameters that\\ndetermine the values of the critical interactive system variables\\nare the transmit power and rate of the network nodes. The\\ndecoding capability of the receiver depends on the signal-tointerference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the receiver and SINR\\ncriteria. SINR is obviously the ratio of the signal power to the\\ntotal power of noise and interference, while SINR criteria is\\ndetermined by the transmission rate and decoding capability\\nof the receiver. The increase in the transmit power of the transmitter increases SINR at the receiver. However, the increase in\\nthe transmit power at the neighboring nodes causes a decrease\\nat the SINR, due to the increase in interference. Optimizing\\nthe transmit power of neighboring nodes is, therefore, critical\\nin achieving SINR requirements at the receivers.\\nThe transmit rate determines the SINR threshold at the\\nreceivers. As the transmit rate increases, the required SINR\\nthreshold increases. Moreover, depending on the decoding\\ncapability of the receiver, there may be multiple SINR criteria.\\nFor instance, in successive interference cancellation, multiple\\npackets can be received simultaneously based on the extraction\\nof multiple signals from the received composite signal, through\\nsuccessive decoding [93], [130].\\nIEEE 802.15.4 allows the adjustment of both transmit power\\nand rate. However, WirelessHART and ISA-100.11a use fixed\\npower and rate, operating at the suboptimal region.\\n2) Medium Access Control: MAC protocols fall into one\\nof three categories: contention-based access, schedule-based\\naccess, and hybrid access protocols.\\n\\nContention-based Access Protocol: Contention-based random access protocols used in WNCS mostly adopt the\\nCSMA/CA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.4. The values of\\nthe parameters that determine the probability distribution\\nof delay, message loss probability, and energy consumption include the minimum and maximum value of backoff\\nexponent, denoted by macM inBE and macM axBE, respectively, and maximum number of backoff stages, called\\nmacM axCSM ABackof f s. Similarly to IEEE 802.15.4, the\\ncorresponding parameters for IEEE 802.11 MAC include the\\nIFS time, contention window size, number of tries to sense\\nthe clean channel, and retransmission limits due to missing\\nACKs.\\nThe energy consumption of CSMA/CA has been shown\\nto be mostly dominated by the constant listening to the\\nchannel [85], [84]. Therefore, various energy conservation\\nmechanisms adopting low duty-cycle operation have later been\\nproposed [131]–[134]. In low duty-cycle operation, the nodes\\nperiodically cycle between a sleep and listening state, with\\nthe corresponding durations of sleep time and listen time,\\nrespectively. Low duty-cycle protocols may be synchronous\\nor asynchronous. In synchronous duty-cycle protocols, the\\nlisten and sleep time of neighboring nodes are aligned in\\ntime [131], [132]. However, this requires an extra overhead for\\nsynchronization and exchange of schedules. In asynchronous\\nduty-cycle protocols, on the other hand, the transmitting node\\nsends a long preamble [133] or multiple short preambles [134]\\nto guarantee the wakeup of the receiver node. The duty-cycle\\nparameters, i.e., sleep time and listen time, significantly affect\\nthe delay, message loss probability, and energy consumption\\nof the network. Using a larger sleep time reduces the energy\\nconsumption in idle listening at the receiver, while increasing\\nthe energy consumption at the transmitter due to the transmission of longer preamble. Moreover, the increase in sleep\\ntime significantly degrades the performance of message delay\\nand reliability due to the high contention in the medium with\\nincreasing traffic.\\nSchedule-based Access Protocol: Schedule-based protocols\\nare based on assigning time slots, of possibly variable length,\\nand frequency bands to a subset of nodes for concurrent\\ntransmission. Since the nodes know when to transmit or\\nreceive a packet, they can put their radio in sleep mode\\nwhen they are not scheduled for any activity. The scheduling\\nalgorithms can be classified into two categories: fixed priority\\nscheduling and dynamic priority scheduling [135]. In fixed\\npriority scheduling, each flow is assigned a fixed priority\\noff-line as a function of its periodicity parameters, including\\nsampling period and delay constraint. For instance, in rate\\nmonotonic and deadline monotonic scheduling, the flows are\\nassigned priorities as a function of their sampling periods and\\ndeadlines, respectively: The shorter the sampling period and\\ndeadline, the higher the priority. Fixed priority scheduling\\nalgorithms are preferred due to their simplicity and lower\\nscheduling overhead but are typically non-optimal since they\\ndo not take the urgency of transmissions into account. On\\nthe other hand, in dynamic priority scheduling algorithms, the\\npriority of the flow changes over time depending on the execution of the schedule. For instance, in Earliest Deadline First\\n\\n\f15\\n\\n(EDF) Scheduling, the transmission closest to the deadline\\nwill be given highest priority, so, scheduled next; whereas\\nin least laxity first algorithm, the priority is assigned based\\non the slack time, which is defined as the amount of time\\nleft after the transmission if the transmission started now.\\nAlthough dynamic priority scheduling algorithms have higher\\nscheduling overhead, they perform much better due to the\\ndynamic adjustment of priorities over time.\\nHybrid Access Protocol: Hybrid protocols aim to combine the advantages of contention-based random access and\\nschedule-based protocols: Random access eliminates the overhead of scheduling and synchronization, whereas scheduled\\naccess provides message delay and reliability guarantees by\\neliminating collisions. IEEE 802.15.4 already provides such\\na hybrid architecture for flexible usage depending on the\\napplication requirements [112].\\n3) Network Routing: On the network layer, the routing\\nprotocol plays an extremely important role in achieving high\\nreliability and real-time forwarding together with energy efficiency for large scale WNCS, such as large-scale aircraft\\navionics and industrial automation. Various routing protocols\\nare proposed to achieve energy efficiency for traditional WSN\\napplications [136], [137]. However, to deal with much harsher\\nand noisier environments, the routing protocol must additionally provide reliable real-time transmissions [28]. Multipath\\nrouting has been extensively studied in wireless networks\\nfor overcoming wireless errors and improving routing reliability [138], [139]. Most of previous works focus on identifying multiple link/node-disjoint paths to guarantee energy\\nefficiency and robustness against node failures [138], [140].\\nISA 100.11a and WirelessHART employ a simple and\\nreliable routing mechanism called graph routing to enhance\\nnetwork reliability through multiple routing paths. When using\\ngraph routing, the network manager builds multiple graphs\\nof each flow. Each graph includes some device numbers and\\nforwarding list with unique graph identification. Based on\\nthese graphs, the manager generates the corresponding subroutes for each node and transmits to every node. Hence,\\nall nodes on the path to the destination are pre-configured\\nwith graph information that specifies the neighbors to which\\nthe packets may be forwarded. For example, if the link of\\nthe sub-routes is broken, then the node forwards the packet\\nto another neighbor of other sub-routes corresponding to the\\nsame flow. There has been an increasing interest in developing\\nnew approaches for graph routing with different routing costs\\ndependent on reliability, delay, and energy consumption [113],\\n[141], [142].\\nRPL employs the objective function to specify the selection\\nof the routes in meeting the QoS requirements of the applications. Various routing metrics have been proposed in the\\nobjective function to compute the rank value of the nodes in\\nthe network. The rank represents the virtual coordinate of the\\nnode, i.e., its distance to the DODAG root with respect to a\\ngiven metric. Some approaches propose the usage of a single\\nmetric, including link expected transmission count [143],\\n[144], node remaining energy, link delay [145], MAC based\\nmetrics considering packet losses due to contention [146] and\\nqueue utilization [147], [148]. [149] proposes two methods,\\n\\nVI. Control System Analysis and Design\\nVI.A.

In simple combination, the rank of the\\nnode is determined by using a composition function as the\\nweighted sum of the ranks of two selected metrics. In lexical\\ncombination, the node selects the neighbor with the lower\\nvalue of the first selected metric, and if they are equal in\\nthe first metric, the node selects the one with the lower value\\nof the second composition metric. Finally, [150] combines a\\nset of these metrics in order to provide a configurable routing\\ndecision depending on the application requirements based on\\nthe fuzzy parameters.\\nVI. C ONTROL S YSTEM A NALYSIS\\n\\nAND\\n\\nD ESIGN\\n\\nThis section provides a brief overview of the analysis\\nand design of control systems to deal with the non-ideal\\ncritical interactive system variables resulting from the wireless\\nnetwork. The presence of an imperfect wireless network\\ndegrades the performance of the control loop and can even\\nlead to instability. Therefore, it is important to understand\\nhow these interactive system variables influence the closedloop performance in a quantitative manner. Fig. 9 illustrates\\nthe section structure and relations.\\nControl system analysis has two main usages here: requirement definition for the network design and the actual control\\nalgorithm design. First, since the control cost depends on the\\nnetwork performance such as message loss and delay, the\\nexplicit set of requirements for the wireless network design\\nare determined to meet a certain control performance. This\\nallows the optimization of the network design to meet the\\ngiven constraints imposed by the control system instead of just\\nimproving the reliability, delay, or energy efficiency. Second,\\nbased on the control system analysis, the controller is designed\\nto guarantee the control performance under imperfect network\\noperation.\\nDespite the interdependence between the three critical interactive variables of sampling period, message delay, and\\nmessage dropout, as we have discussed in Section IV, much\\nof the available literature on NCS considers only a subset of\\nthese variables due to the high complexity of the problem.\\nSince any practical wireless network incurs imperfect network\\nperformance, the WNCS designers must carefully consider the\\nperformance feasibility and tradeoffs. Previous studies in the\\n\\n\f16\\n\\nliterature analyze the stability of control systems by considering either only wireless sensor–controller channel, e.g., [151],\\n[152], [153] or both sensor–controller and controller–actuator,\\ne.g., [104], [53], [154], [155], [156], [157], [158], [159].\\nHybrid system and Markov jump linear system have been\\napplied for the modeling and control of NCS under message\\ndropout and message delay. The hybrid or switched system\\napproach refers to continuous-time dynamics with (isolated)\\ndiscrete switching events [160]. Mathematically, these components are usually described by a collection of indexed differential or difference equations. For NCS, a continuous-time\\ncontrol system can be modelled as the continuous dynamics\\nand network effects such as message dropouts and message\\ndelays are modelled as the discrete dynamics [154], [155],\\n[156], [157], [161]. Compared to switched systems, in Markov\\njump linear system the mode switches are governed by a\\nstochastic process that is statistically independent from the\\nstate values [162]. Markov systems may provide less conservative requirements than switched systems. However, the\\nnetwork performance must support the independent transitions\\nbetween states. In other words, this technique is effective if the\\nnetwork performance is statistically independent or modelled\\nas a simple Markov model.\\nThe above theoretical approaches can be used to derive\\nnetwork requirements as a function of the sampling period, message dropout, and message delay. Some network\\nrequirements are explicitly related to the message dropout\\nand message delay, such as maximum allowable message\\ndropout probability, number of consecutive message dropouts,\\nand message delay. Furthermore, since various analytical tools\\nonly provide sufficient conditions for closed-loop stability,\\ntheir requirements might be too conservative. In fact, many\\nexisting results are shown to be conservative in simulation\\nstudies and finding tighter bounds on the network is an area\\nof great interest [53], [152], [54].\\nTo highlight the importance of the sampling mechanism, we\\nclassify NCS analysis and design methods into time-triggered\\nsampling and event-triggered sampling.\\nA. Time-Triggered Sampling\\nTime-triggered NCSs can be classified into two categories\\nbased on the relationship between sampling period and message delay: hard sampling period and soft sampling period.\\nThe message delay of hard sampling period is smaller than\\nthe sampling period. The network discards the message if is\\nnot successfully transmitted within its sampling period and\\ntries to transmit the latest sampled message for the hard\\nsampling period. On the other hand, the node of the soft\\nsampling period continues to transmit the outdated messages\\neven after its sampling period. The wireless network design\\nmust take into account which time-triggered sampling method\\nis implemented.\\n1) Hard Sampling Period: The message dropouts of NCSs\\nare generally modelled as stochastic variables with and without\\nlimited number of consecutive message dropouts. Hence, we\\nclassify hard sampling period into unbounded consecutive\\nmessage dropout and bounded consecutive message dropout.\\n\\nUnbounded Consecutive Message Dropout: When the controller is collocated with the actuators, a Markov jump linear\\nsystem can be used to analyze the effect of the message\\ndropout [151], [153], [64], [163]. In [151], [153], the message\\ndropout is modelled as a Bernoulli random process with\\ndropout probability p ∈ [0, 1). Under the Bernoulli dropout\\nmodel, the system model of the augmented state is a special\\ncase of a discrete-time Markov jump linear system. The matrix\\ntheory is used to show exponential stability of the NCS with\\ndropout probability p. The stability condition interpreted as a\\nlinear matrix inequality is a useful tool to design the output\\nfeedback controller as well as requirement derivation of the\\nmaximum allowable probability of message dropouts for the\\nnetwork design. However, the main results of [151], [153] are\\nhard to apply for wireless network design since they ignore the\\nmessage delay for a fixed sampling period. Furthermore, the\\nlink reliability of wireless networks does not follow a Bernoulli\\nrandom process since wireless links are highly correlated over\\ntime and space in practice [164], [165].\\nWhile the sensor–controller communication is considered\\nwithout any delays in [151], [153], the sensor–controller and\\ncontroller–actuator channels are modelled as two switches\\nindicating whether the corresponding message is dropped or\\nnot in [157]. A discrete-time switched system is used to\\nmodel the closed-loop NCS with message dropouts when\\nthe message delay and sampling period are fixed. By using\\nswitched system theory, sufficient conditions for exponential\\nstability are presented in terms of nonlinear matrix inequalities.\\nThe proposed methods provide an explicit relation between\\nthe message dropout rate and the stability of the NCS. Such\\na quantitative relation enables the design of a state feedback\\ncontroller guaranteeing the stability of the closed-loop NCS\\nunder a certain message dropout rate. The network may assign\\na fixed time slot for a single packet associated to the message\\nto guarantee the constant message delay. However, since\\nthis does not allow any retransmissions, it will significantly\\ndegrade the message dropout rate. Another way to achieve\\nconstant message delay may be to buffer the received packet\\nat the sink. However, this will again degrade the control\\nperformance with higher average delay.\\nIn order to apply the results of [151], [153], [157], the\\nwireless network needs to monitor the message dropout probability and adapt its operation in order to meet the maximum\\nallowable probability of message dropouts. These results can\\nfurther be used to save network resources while preserving the\\nstability of the NCS by dropping messages at a certain rate.\\nIn fact, most NCS research focuses on the stability analysis\\nand design of the control algorithm rather than explicit derivation of network requirements useful for the wireless network\\ndesign. Since the joint design of controller and wireless\\nnetworks necessitates the derivation of the required message\\ndropout probability and message delay to achieve the desired\\ncontrol cost, [166] provides the formulation of the control\\ncost function as a function of the sampling period, message\\ndropout probability, and message delay. Most NCS researches\\nuse the linear quadratic cost function as the control objective.\\nThe model combines the stochastic models of the message\\ndropout [22] and the message delay [100]. Furthermore, the\\n\\n\f17\\n\\nestimator and controller are obtained by extending the results\\nof the optimal stochastic estimator and controller of [22],\\n[100]. Given a control cost, numerical methods are used to\\nderive a set of the network requirements imposed on the\\nsampling period, message dropout, and message delay. One\\nof the major drawbacks is the high computation complexity\\nto quantify the control cost in order to find the feasible region\\nof the network requirements.\\nBounded Consecutive Message Dropout: Some NCS literatures [155], [161] assume limited number of consecutive\\nmessage dropouts, such hard requirements are unreasonable\\nfor wireless networks where the packet loss probability is\\ngreater than zero at any point in time. Hence, some other\\napproaches [15], [167], [168] set stochastic constraints on the\\nmaximum allowable number of consecutive message dropouts.\\nControl theory provides deterministic bounds on the\\nmaximum allowable number of consecutive message\\ndropouts [155], [161]. In [161], a switched linear system\\nis used to model NCSs with constant message delay and\\narbitrary but finite message dropout over the sensor–controller\\nchannel. The message dropout is said to be arbitrary if the\\nsampling sequence of the successfully applied actuation\\nis an arbitrary variable within the maximum number of\\nconsecutive message dropouts. Based on the stability criterion\\nof the switched system, a linear matrix inequality is used to\\nanalyze sufficient conditions for stability. Then, the maximum\\nallowable bound of consecutive message dropouts and the\\nfeedback controllers are derived via the feasible solution of a\\nlinear matrix inequality.\\nA Lyapunov-based characterization of stability is provided\\nand explicit bounds on the Maximum Allowable Transfer\\nInterval (MATI) and the Maximally Allowable Delay (MAD)\\nare derived to guarantee the control stability of NCSs, by\\nconsidering time-varying sampling period and time-varying\\nmessage delays, in [155]. If there are message dropouts for\\nthe time-triggered sampling, its effect is modelled as a timevarying sampling period from receiver point-of-view. MATI is\\nthe upper bound on the transmission interval for which stability can be guaranteed. If the network performance exceeds the\\ngiven MATI or MAD, then the stability of the overall system\\ncould not be guaranteed. The developed results lead to tradeoff\\ncurves between MATI and MAD. These tradeoff curves provide effective quantitative information to the network designer\\nwhen selecting the requirements to guarantee stability and a\\ndesirable level of control performance.\\nMany control applications, such as wireless industrial automation [15], air transportation systems [167], and autonomous vehicular systems [168], set a stochastic MATI\\nconstraint in the form of keeping the time interval between\\nsubsequent state vector reports above the MATI value with\\na predefined probability to guarantee the stability of control\\nsystems. Stochastic MATI constraint is an efficient abstraction\\nof the performance of the control systems since it is directly\\nrelated to the deadline of the real-time scheduling of the\\nnetwork design [101].\\n2) Soft Sampling Period: Sometimes it is reasonable to\\nrelax the strict assumption on the message delay being smaller\\nthan the sampling period. Some works assume the eventual\\n\\nsuccessful transmission of all messages with various types of\\ndeterministic or stochastic message delays [104], [53]. Since\\nthe packet retransmission corresponding to the message is\\nallowed beyond its sampling period, one can consider the\\npacket loss as a message delay. While the actuating signal\\nis updated after the message delay of each sampling period if\\nthe delay is smaller than its sampling period [104], [54], the\\ndelays longer than one sampling period may result in more\\nthan one (or none) arriving during a single sampling period. It\\nmakes the derivation of recursive formulas of the augmented\\nmatrix of closed-loop system harder, compared to the hard\\nsampling period case.\\nTo avoid high computation complexity, an alternative approach defines slightly different augmented state to use the\\nstability results of switched systems in [53]. Even though the\\nstability criterion defines the MATI and MAD requirements,\\nthere are fundamental limits of this approach to apply for wireless networks. The stability results hold if there is no message\\ndropout for the fixed sampling period and constant message\\ndelay, since the augmented matrix consiered is a function of\\nthe fixed sampling period with the constant message delay.\\nHence, the MATI and MAD requirements are only used to\\nset the fixed sampling period and message delay deadline.\\nOn the other hand, the NCS of [155] uses the time-varying\\nsampling and varying message delay to take into account the\\nmessage dropout and stochastic message delay. Hence, the\\nMATI and MAD requirements of [155] are more practical\\ncontrol constraints than the ones of [53] to apply to wireless\\nnetwork design.\\nIn [159], a stochastic optimal controller is proposed to\\ncompensate long message delays of the sensor–controller\\nchannel for fixed sampling period. The stochastic delay is\\nassumed to be bounded with a known probability density\\nfunction. Hence, the network manager needs to provide the\\nstochastic delay model by analyzing delay measurements. In\\nboth [53] and [159], the NCSs assume the eventual successful\\ntransmission of all messages. This approach is only reasonable\\nif MATI is large enough compared to the sampling period to\\nguarantee the eventual successful transmission of messages\\nwith high probability. However, it is not applicable for fast\\ndynamical system (i.e., small MATI requirement).\\nWhile [53], [159] do not explicitly consider message\\ndropouts, [152] jointly considers the message dropout and\\nmessage delay longer than the fixed sampling period over the\\nsensor–controller channel. From the derived stability criteria,\\nthe controller is designed and the MAD requirement is determined under a fixed message dropout rate by solving a set\\nof matrix inequalities. Even though the message dropout and\\nmessage delay are considered, the tradeoff between performance measures is not explicitly derived. However, it is still\\npossible to obtain tradeoff curves by using numerical methods.\\nThe network is allowed to transmit the packet associated to\\nthe message within the MAD. The network also monitors\\nthe message dropout rate. Stability is guaranteed if the message dropout rate is lower than its maximum allowable rate.\\nFurthermore, the network may discard outdated messages to\\nefficiently utilize the network resource as long as the message\\ndropout rate requirement is satisfied.\\n\\n\f18\\n\\nB. Event-Triggered Sampling\\nEvent-triggered control is reactive since it generates sensor\\nmeasurements and control commands when the plant state\\ndeviates more than a certain threshold from a desired value. On\\nthe other hand, self-triggered control is proactive since it computes the next sampling or actuation instance ahead of current\\ntime. Event- and self-triggered control have been demonstrated\\nto significantly reduce the network traffic load [75], [80].\\nMotivated by those advantages, a systematic design of eventbased implementations of stabilizing feedback control laws\\nwas performed in [77].\\nEvent-triggered and self-triggered control systems consist of\\ntwo elements, namely, a feedback controller that computes the\\ncontrol command, and a triggering mechanism that determines\\nwhen the control input has to be updated again. The triggering\\nmechanism directly affects the traffic load [80]. There are\\nmany proposals for the triggering rule in the event-triggered\\nliterature. Suppose that the state x(t) of the physical plant is\\navailable. One of the traditional objectives of event-triggered\\ncontrol is to maintain the condition\\nk x(t) − x(tk ) k≤ δ,\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nwhere tk denotes the time instant when the last control task is\\nexecuted (the last event time) and δ > 0 is a threshold [79].\\nThe next event time instant is defined as\\ntk+1 = inf {t > tk | k x(t) − x(tk ) k> δ} .\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThe sensor of the event-triggered control loop continuously\\nmonitors the current plant state and evaluates the triggering\\ncondition. Network traffic is generated if the plant state\\ndeviates by the threshold. The network design problem is\\nparticularly challenging because the wireless network must\\nsupport the randomly generated traffic. Furthermore, eventtriggered control does not provide high energy efficiency since\\nthe node must continuously activate the sensing part of the\\nhardware platform.\\nSelf-triggered control determines its next execution time\\nbased on the previously received data and the triggering\\nrule [82]. Self-triggered control is basically an emulation\\nof an event-triggered rule, where one considers the model\\nof the plant and controller to compute the next triggering\\ntime. Hence, it is predictive sampling based on the plant\\nmodels and controller rules. This approach is generally more\\nconservative than the event-triggered approach since it is based\\non approximate models and predicted events. The explicit\\nallocation of network resources based on these predictions\\nimproves the real-time performance and energy efficiency\\nof the wireless network. However, since event- and selftriggered control generate fewer messages, the message loss\\nand message delay might seem to be more critical than for\\ntime-triggered control [75].\\nC. Comparison Between Time- and Event-Triggered Sampling\\nOne of the fundamental issues is to compare the performance of time-triggered sampling and event-triggered sampling approaches by using various channel access mechanisms [169], [88], [170]. In fact, many event-based control researches show performance improvement since it often reduces\\n\\nthe network utilization [81], [169]. However, recent works of\\nthe event-based control using the random access show control\\nperformance limitations in the case when there are a large\\nnumber of control loops [88], [170]. [169] considers a control\\nsystem where a number of time-triggered or event-triggered\\ncontrol loops are closed over a shared communication network.\\nThis research is one of the inspiring works of WNCS codesign problem, where both the control policy and network\\nscheduling policy have been taken into account. The overall\\ntarget of the framework is to minimize the sum of the\\nstationary state variance of the control loops. A Dirac pulse\\nis applied to achieve the minimum plant state variance as\\nthe control law. The sampling can be either time-triggered or\\nevent-triggered, depending on the MAC schemes such as the\\ntraditional TDMA, FDMA, and CSMA schemes. Intuitively,\\nTDMA is used for the time-triggered sampling, while the\\nevent-triggered sampling is applied for CSMA. Based on the\\nprevious work [171], the event-triggered approach is also\\nused for FDMA since the event-triggered sampling with a\\nminimum event interval T performs better than the one using\\nthe time-triggered sampling with the same time interval T . The\\nauthors of [169] assume that once the MAC protocol gains\\nthe network resource, the network is busy for specific delay\\nfrom sensor to actuator, after which the control command is\\napplied to the plant. The simulation results show that eventtriggered control using CSMA gives the best performance.\\nEven though the main tradeoffs and conclusions of the paper\\nare interesting, some assumptions are not realistic. In practice,\\nthe Dirac pulse controls are unrealistic due to the capability\\nlimit of actuators. For simplicity, the authors assume that the\\ncontention resolution time of CSMA is negligible compared\\nto the transmission time. This assumption is not realistic\\nfor general wireless channel access schemes such as IEEE\\n802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11. Furthermore, the total bandwidth\\nresource of FDMA is assumed to scale in proportion to\\nthe number of plants, such that the transmission delay from\\nsensor to actuator is inversely proportional to the number of\\nplants. These assumptions are not practical since the frequency\\nspectrum is a limited resource for general wireless networks,\\nthus further studies are needed.\\nWhile most previous works on event-based control consider\\na single control loop or small number of control loops, [88]\\ncompares time-triggered control and event-based control for a\\nNCS consisting of a large number of plants. The pure ALOHA\\nprotocol is used for the event-based control of NCSs. The\\nauthors show that packet losses due to collisions drastically\\nreduce the performance of event-based control if packets are\\ntransmitted whenever the event-based control generates an\\nevent. Remark that the instability of the ALOHA network\\nitself is a well known problem in communications [172]. It\\nturns out that in this setup time-triggered control is superior\\nto event-based control. The same authors also analyze the\\ntradeoff between delay and loss for event-based control with\\nslotted ALOHA [170]. They show that the slotted ALOHA\\nsignificantly improve the control cost of the state variance\\nrespect to the one of the pure ALOHA. However, the timetriggered control still performs better. Therefore, it is hard\\nto generalize the performance comparison between time-\\n\\n\f19\\n\\ntriggered sampling and event-triggered sampling approaches\\nsince it really depends on the network protocol and topology.\\nVII.

We distinguish interactive design approach and joint design approach. In the\\ninteractive design approach, the wireless network parameters\\nare tuned to satisfy given constraints on the critical interactive system variables, possibly enforced by the required\\ncontrol system performance. In the joint design approach, the\\nwireless network and control system parameters are jointly\\noptimized considering their interaction through the critical system variables. Fig. 10 illustrates the section structure related\\nto previous Sections V and VI. In Table II, we summarize\\nthe characteristics of the related works. In the table, we\\nhave demonstrated whether indications of requirements and\\ncommunication and control parameters have been included\\nin the network design or optimization for WNCS. Table III\\nclassifies previous design approaches of WNCS based on\\ncontrol and communication aspects. Furthermore, Table IV\\ncategorizes previous works based on the wireless standards\\ndescribed in Section V-A.\\nA. Interactive Design Approach\\nIn the interactive design approach, wireless network parameters are tuned to satisfy the given requirements of the control\\nsystem. Most of the interactive design approaches assume\\ntime-triggered control systems, in which sensor samples are\\ngenerated periodically at predetermined rates. They generally\\nassume that the requirements of the control systems are\\ngiven in the form of upper bounds on the message delay or\\nmessage dropout with a fixed sampling period. The adoption\\nof wireless communication technologies for supporting control\\napplications heavily depends on the ability to guarantee the\\nbounded service times for messages, at least from a probabilistic point of view. This aspect is particularly important in\\ncontrol systems, where the real-time requirement is considered\\nmuch more significant than other performance metrics, such\\nas throughput, that are usually important in other application\\nareas. Note that the real-time performance of wireless networks heavily depends on the message delay and message\\ndropout. Hence, we mainly discuss the deadline-constrained\\nMAC protocols of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11. Different\\nanalytical techniques can provide the explicit requirements\\nof control systems for wireless networks, as we discussed\\nin Section VI. The focus of previous research is mainly\\non the design and optimization of MAC, network resource\\nscheduling, and routing layer, with limited efforts additionally\\nconsidering physical layer parameters.\\n1) Medium Access Control: Research on real-time 802.15.4\\nand 802.11 networks can be classified into two groups.

The adaptive tuning algorithms are either measurement-based or model-based adaptation.\\nThe measurement-based adaptation techniques do not require any network model but rather depend on the local\\nmeasurements of packet delivery characteristics. Early works\\nof IEEE 802.15.4 propose adaptive algorithms to dynamically\\nchange the value of only a single parameter. [212], [213] adaptively determine minimum contention window size, denoted by\\nmacM inBE, to decrease the delay and packet loss probability\\nof nodes and increase overall throughput. The references [175],\\n[174] extend these studies to autonomously adjust all the\\nCSMA/CA parameters. The ADAPT protocol [175] adapts\\nthe parameter values with the goal of minimizing energy\\nconsumption while meeting packet delivery probability based\\non their local estimates. However, ADAPT tends to oscillate\\nbetween two or more parameters sets. This results in high\\nenergy consumption. [174] solves this oscillation problem by\\ntriggering the adaptation mechanism only upon the detection of a change in operating conditions. Furthermore, [214]\\naims to optimize duty-cycle parameters based on a linear\\nincrease/linear decrease of the duty-cycle depending on the\\ncomparison of the successfully received packet rate and its\\ntarget value while minimizing the energy consumption.\\nModel-based parameter optimization mainly use theoretical\\nor experimental-based derivations of the probability distribu-\\n\\n\f20\\n\\nL\\nTABLE II: Comparison of related works.

It handles periodic traffic by using two\\nspecific mechanisms, namely, a contention-sensitive backoff\\nmechanism and a deadline-sensitive retry limit assignment\\nmechanism. The backoff algorithm offers bounded backoff\\ndelays, whereas the deadline-sensitive retry limit assignment\\nmechanism differentiates the retry limits for periodic traffic\\nin terms of their respective deadline requirements.

Similarly, both worst-case and\\nprobabilisitic delay bounds have been derived by considering\\nchannel contention and transmission conflicts. These analyses\\nconsider multihop multichannel networks with fixed time slots\\nwithout incorporating any transmit power or rate adjustment\\nmechanism.\\nThe real-time dynamic priority scheduling of periodic\\ndeadline-constrained flows in a WirelessHART network has\\nbeen shown to be NP-hard in [187]. Upon determining necessary condition for schedulability, an optimal branch-andbound scheduling is proposed, effectively discarding infeasible\\nbranches in the search space. Moreover, a faster heuristic\\nconflict-aware least laxity first algorithm is developed by\\nassigning priorities to the nodes based on the criticality of their\\ntransmission. The conflict-aware laxity is defined as the laxity\\nafter discarding time slots that can be wasted while waiting\\nto avoid transmission conflicts.

The\\ndelay is bounded by considering the channel contention and\\ntransmission conflict delays. The EDF has been shown to\\noutperform fixed priority scheduling in terms of real-time\\nperformance.\\nRobustness Enhancement: The predetermined nature of\\nschedule-based transmissions allows the incorporation of var-\\n\\nious retransmission mechanisms in case of packet losses at\\nrandom time instants. Although explicit scheduling is used to\\nprevent various types of conflict and contention, still transmission failures may occur due to multipath fading and external\\ninterference in harsh and unstable environments. Some of the\\nretransmission mechanisms have been introduced at the link\\nlayer [183], [219], [220]. Since schedule is known apriori by\\nthe nodes in the network, the retransmissions can be minimized\\nby exploiting the determinism in the packet headers to recover\\nthe unknown bytes of the header [183]. Moreover, various\\nefficient retransmission procedures can be used to minimize\\nthe number of bits in the retransmissions [219], [220]. [219]\\nuses symbol decoding confidence, whereas [220] uses received\\nsignal strength variations to determine the parts of the packet\\nreceived in error, so, should be retransmitted.\\nThe retransmission mechanisms at the network layer aim\\nto determine the best timing and quantity of shared and/or\\nseparate time slots given the link quality statistics [199], [184],\\n[185], [186]. [184] combines the retransmissions with realtime worst-case scheduling analysis. The number of possible retransmissions of a packet is limited considering the\\ncorresponding deadline and already guaranteed delay bounds\\nof other packets. [185] proposes a scheduling algorithm that\\nprovides delay guarantees for the periodic real-time flows considering both link bursts and interference. A new metric called\\nmaximum burst length is defined as the maximum length of\\nerror burst, estimated by using empirical data. The algorithm\\nthen provides reliability guarantee by allocating each link one\\nplus its corresponding maximum burst length time slots. A\\nnovel least-burst-route algorithm is used in conjunction with\\nthis scheduling algorithm to minimize the sum of worst case\\nburst lengths over all links in the route. Similarly, [186]\\nincreases the spacing between the actual transmission and\\nthe first retransmission for maximum reliability instead of\\nallocating all the time slots in between. [199] improves the retransmission efficiency by using limited number of shared slots\\nefficiently through fast slot competition and segmented slot\\nassignment. Shared resources are allocated for retransmission\\ndue to its unpredictability. Fast slot competition is introduced\\nby embedding more than one clear channel assessment at the\\nbeginning of the shared slots to reduce the rate of collision.\\nOn the other hand, segmented slot assignment provides the\\nretransmission chances for a routing hop before its following\\nhop arrives.\\n3) Network Routing: There has been increasing interest in\\ndeveloping efficient multipath routing to improve the network\\nreliability and energy efficiency of wireless networks. Previous works of the multipath routings are classified into four\\ncategories based on the underlying key ideas of the routing\\nmetric and the operation: disjoint path routing, graph routing,\\ncontrolled flooding, and energy/QoS-aware routing.\\nDisjoint Path Routing: Most of previous works focus on\\nidentifying multiple disjoint paths from source to destination\\nto guarantee the routing reliability against node or link failures\\nsince multiple paths may fail independently [138], [140]. The\\ndisjoint paths have two types: node-disjoint and link-disjoint.\\nWhile node-disjoint paths do not have any relay node in\\ncommon, link-disjoint paths do not have any common link but\\n\\n\f24\\n\\nmay have common nodes. [138] provides the node-disjoint and\\nbraided multipath schemes to provide the resilience against\\nnode failures. Ad-hoc On-demand Multipath Distance Vector\\n(AOMDV) is a multipath extension of a well-studied single\\npath routing protocol of Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector\\n(AODV) [140].\\nGraph Routing: Graph routing of ISA 100.11a and WirelessHART leads to significant improvement over a single\\npath in terms of worst-case reliability due to the usage of\\nmultiple paths. Since the standards do not explicitly define\\nthe mechanism to build these multiple paths, it is possible\\nto use the existing algorithms of the disjoint path. Multiple\\nrouting paths from each node to the destination are formed by\\ngenerating the subgraphs containing all the shortest paths for\\neach source and destination pair [141]. Real-time link quality\\nestimation is integrated into the generation of subgraphs for\\nbetter reliability in [142]. [113] proposes an algorithm to\\nconstruct three types of reliable routing graphs, namely, uplink\\ngraph, downlink graph, and broadcast graph for different communication purposes. While the uplink graph is a graph that\\nconnects all nodes upward to the gateway, the downlink graph\\nof the gateway is a graph to send unicast messages to each\\nnode of the network. The broadcast graph connects gateway\\nto all nodes of the network for the transmission of operational\\ncontrol commands. Three algorithms are proposed to build\\nthese graphs based on the concepts of (k, m)-reliability where\\nk and m are the minimum required number of incoming and\\noutgoing edges of all nodes excluding the gateway, respectively. The communication schedule is constructed based on\\nthe traffic load requirements and the hop sequence of the\\nrouting paths.\\nRecently, the graph routing problem has been formulated\\nas an optimization problem where the objective function is to\\nmaximize network lifetime, namely, the time interval before\\nthe first node exhausts its battery, for a given connectivity\\ngraph and battery capacity of nodes [200]. This optimization\\nproblem has been shown to be NP-hard. A suboptimal algorithm based on integer programming and a greedy heuristic\\nalgorithm have been proposed for the optimization problem.\\nThe proposed algorithm shows significant improvement in the\\nnetwork lifetime while guaranteeing the high reliability of\\ngraph routing.\\nControlled Flooding: Previous approaches of disjoint routing and graph routing focus on how to build the routing paths\\nand distribute the traffic load over the network. Some control\\napplications may define more stringent requirements on the\\nrouting reliability in the harsher and noisier environments.\\nTo address the major reliability issue, a reliable Real-time\\nFlooding-based Routing protocol (REALFLOW) is proposed\\nfor industrial applications [188]. REALFLOW controls the\\nflooding mechanism to further improve the multipath diversity while reducing the overhead. Each node transmits the\\nreceived packet to the corresponding multiple routing paths\\ninstead of all feasible outgoing links. Furthermore, it discards\\nthe duplicated packets and outdated packets to reduce the\\noverhead. For both uplink and downlink transmissions, the\\nsame packets are forwarded according to the related node\\nlists in all relay nodes. Due to redundant paths and flooding\\n\\nmechanism, REALFLOW can be tolerant to network topology\\nchanges. Furthermore, since related node lists are distributively\\ngenerated, the workloads of the gateway are greatly reduced.\\nThe flooding schedule is also extended by using the received\\nsignal strength in [222].\\nEnergy/QoS-aware Routing: Even though some multipath\\nroutings such as disjoint path, graph routing, and controlled\\nflooding lead to significant reliability improvement, they also\\nincrease the cost of the energy consumption. Energy/QoSaware routing jointly considers the application requirements\\nand energy consumption of the network [21]. Several energybalanced routing strategies are proposed to maximize the\\nnetwork lifetime while meeting the strict requirements for\\nindustrial applications.\\nBreath is proposed to ensure a desired packet delivery and\\ndelay probabilities while minimizing the energy consumption\\nof the network [18]. The protocol is based on randomized\\nrouting, MAC, and duty-cycling jointly optimized for energy\\nefficiency. The design approach relies on a constrained optimization problem, whereby the objective function is the energy\\nconsumption and the constraints are the packet reliability and\\ndelay. The optimal working point of the protocol is achieved\\nby a simple algorithm, which adapts to traffic variations and\\nchannel conditions with negligible overhead.\\nEARQ is another energy aware routing protocol for reliable and real-time communications for industrial applications [128]. EARQ is a proactive routing protocol, which\\nmaintains an ongoing routing table updated through the exchange of beacon messages among neighboring nodes. A\\nbeacon message contains expected values such as energy cost,\\nresidual energy of a node, reliability and end-to-end message\\ndelay. Once a node gets a new path to the destination, it will\\nbroadcast a beacon message to its neighbors. When a node\\nwants to send a packet to the destination, next hop selections\\nare based on the estimations of energy consumption, reliability,\\nand deadlines. If the packet chooses a path with low reliability,\\nthe source will forward a redundant packet via other paths.\\n[224] proposes the minimum transmission power cooperative routing algorithm, reducing the energy consumption of a\\nsingle route while guaranteeing certain throughput. However,\\nthe algorithm ignores the residual energy and communication\\nload of neighboring nodes, which result in unbalanced energy\\nconsumption among nodes. In addition, in [225], a loadbalanced routing algorithm is proposed where each node\\nalways chooses the next-hop based on the communication\\nload of neighboring nodes. However, the algorithm has heavy\\ncomputation complexity and the communication load is high.\\n[197], [201] propose a two-hop information-based routing\\nprotocol, aiming at enhancing real-time performance with\\nenergy efficiency. The routing decision in [197] is based\\non the integration of the velocity information of two-hop\\nneighbors with energy balancing mechanism, whereas the\\nrouting decision in [201] is based on the number of hops from\\nsource to destination and two-hop information of the velocity.\\nB.

The mean-square error\\nof the estimator is derived as a function of sampling period\\nand delay distribution under the Bernoulli random process of\\nthe packet losses.\\n[166] discusses several fundamental tradeoffs of WNCS\\nover IEEE 802.15.4 networks.

However, the performance of the wireless network\\nis still heavily affected by the operating point of the sampling\\nperiod. Let us consider two feasible sampling periods S and\\nL. By choosing L, the throughput of the network is stabilized\\n(cf., [172]), the control cost is also stabilized with respect\\nto small perturbations of the network operation. Furthermore,\\nthe longer sampling period L leads to lower network energy\\nconsumption than the one of the shorter sampling period S.\\nBased on these observations, an adaptation of the WNCS is\\nproposed by considering a constrained optimization problem.\\nThe objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of\\nthe network subject to a desired control cost.

The optimal network requirements are obtained\\nto minimize the energy consumption of the network out of the\\nfeasible set of network requirements.\\n[195] proposes an interesting approach to the design of\\nWNCS by decomposing the overall concerns into two design\\nspaces. In the control layer, a passive control structure of [216]\\nis used to guarantee the stability of NCSs. The overall NCS\\nperformance is then optimized by adjusting the retransmission\\nlimits of the IEEE 802.11 standard. At the control layer, the\\nauthors leverage their passivity-based architecture to handle\\nthe message delay and message loss. The authors consider\\na passive controller which produces a trajectory of the plant\\nto track and define the control performance as its absolute\\ntracking error. Through extensive simulation results, a convex\\nrelationship between the retransmission limit of IEEE 802.11\\nand the control performance is shown. Based on this observation, a MAC parameter controller is introduced to dynamically\\nadjust the retransmission limit to track the optimal tradeoff between packet losses and delays and thus to optimize the overall\\ncontrol system performance. Simulation results show that the\\nMAC adaptation can converge to a proper retransmission limit\\nwhich optimizes the performance of the control system. Even\\nthough the proposed approach is interesting, the fundamental\\ntradeoff relationships between communication parameters and\\ncontrol performance are not trivial to derive in practice.\\n[196] presents a MPC-based NCS and its implementation\\n\\n\f26\\n\\nover wireless relay networks of IEEE 802.11 and cooperative\\nMAC protocol [217]. The proposed approach deals with the\\nproblem from the control perspective. It basically employs a\\nMPC, an actuator state, and an adaptive IEEE 802.11 MAC\\nto reduce unbounded packet delay and improve the tolerance\\nagainst the packet loss. Furthermore, the cooperative MAC\\nprotocol [217] is used to improve the control performance\\nby enabling reliable and timely data transmission under harsh\\nwireless channel conditions.\\nSchedule-based Access: A novel framework for the\\ncommunication–control joint optimization is proposed encompassing efficient abstraction of control system in the form\\nof stochastic MATI and MAD constraints [4], [190], [87].\\nWe should remember that MATI and MAD are defined as\\nthe maximum allowed time interval between subsequent state\\nvector reports and the maximum allowed packet delay for the\\ntransmission, respectively, as we have discussed in Section VI.\\nSince such hard real-time guarantees cannot be satisfied by\\na wireless network with non-zero packet loss probability,\\nstochastic MATI is introduced with the goal of keeping the\\ntime interval between subsequent state vector reports above\\nthe MATI value with a predefined probability to guarantee the\\nstability of control systems. Further, a novel schedulability\\nconstraint in the form of forcing an adaptive upper bound\\non the sum of the utilization of the nodes, defined as the\\nratio of their delay to their sampling periods, is included to\\nguarantee the schedulability of transmission under variable\\ntransmission rate and sampling period values. The objective of\\nthe optimization is to minimize the total energy consumption\\nof the network while guaranteeing MATI and MAD requirements of the control system and maximum transmit power\\nand schedulability constraints of the wireless communication\\nsystem. The solution for the specific case of M-ary quadrature\\namplitude modulation and EDF scheduling is based on the\\nreduction of the resulting mixed-integer programming problem\\ninto an integer programming problem based on the analysis\\nof the optimality conditions, and relaxation of this reduced\\nproblem [4]. The formulation is also extended for any nondecreasing function of the power consumption of the nodes\\nas the objective, any modulation scheme, and any scheduling\\nalgorithm in [190], [87]. First, an exact solution method\\nbased on the analysis of the optimality conditions and smart\\nenumeration techniques is introduced. Then, two polynomialtime heuristic algorithms adopting intelligent search space\\nreduction and smart searching techniques are proposed. The\\nenergy saving has been demonstrated to increase up to 70%\\nfor a network containing up to 40 nodes.\\n[203] studies utility maximization problem subject to wireless network capacity and delay requirement of control system.\\nThe utility function is defined as the ratio of root-mean-square\\nof the discrete-time system to that of the continuous-time\\ncounterpart. This utility function has been demonstrated to be a\\nstrictly concave function of the sampling period and inversely\\nproportional to tracking error induced by discretization, based\\non the assumption that the plants follow the reference trajectories provided by the controllers.

In the inner loop, a relaxed\\nproblem with fixed delay bound, independent of sampling\\nperiod, is solved via dual decomposition. The outer loop then\\ndetermines optimal delay bounds based on the sampling period\\nas an output of the inner loop.\\n[191] proposes a mathematical framework for modeling and\\nanalyzing multihop NCSs. The authors present the formal\\nsyntax and semantics for the dynamics of the composed\\nsystem, providing an explicit translation of multihop control\\nnetworks to switched systems.

The TDMA\\nMAC protocol is modeled as a scheduler, whose design and\\nparameterization are achieved with the development of the\\ncontrol and the fault detection and identification algorithms\\nat the different functional layers.\\nIn a similar way, [193] investigates the fault estimation\\nproblem based on the deterministic model of the TDMA\\nmechanism. The discrete periodic model of control systems is\\nintegrated with periodic information scheduling model without\\npacket collisions. By adopting the linearity of state equations,\\nthe fault estimator is proposed for the periodic system model\\nwith arbitrary sensor inputs. The fault estimation is obtained\\nafter solving a deterministic quadratic minimization problem\\nof control systems by means of recursive calculation. However,\\nthe scheduler of the wireless network does not consider any\\nrealistic message delays and losses.\\nRouting and Traffic Generation Control: In [189], the\\ncross-layer optimized control (CLOC) protocol is proposed\\nfor minimizing the worst-case performance loss of multiple\\ncontrol systems. CLOC is designed for a general wireless\\nsensor and actuator network where both sensor–controller\\nand controller–actuator connections are over a multihop mesh\\nnetwork. The design approach relies on a constrained maxmin optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize\\nthe minimum resource redundancy of the network and the\\nconstraints are the stability of the closed-loop control systems\\nand the schedulability of the communication resources. The\\nstability condition of the control system has been formulated\\nin the form of stochastic MATI constraint [155]. The optimal\\noperation point of the protocol is automatically set in terms\\nof the sampling period, slot scheduling, and routing, and is\\nachieved by solving a linear programming problem, which\\nadapts to system requirements and link conditions. The performance analysis shows that CLOC ensures control stability\\nand fulfills communication constraints while maximizing the\\nworst-case system performance.\\n[63] presents a case study on a wireless process control\\nsystem that integrates the control design and the wireless\\nrouting of the WirelessHART standard. The network supports\\ntwo routing strategies, namely, single-path source routing\\nand multi-path graph routing. Remind that the graph routing\\nof the WirelessHART standard reduces packet loss through\\npath diversity at the cost of additional overhead and energy\\nconsumption. To mitigate the effect of packet loss in the\\nWNCS, the control design integrates an observer based on\\nan extended Kalman filter with a MPC and an actuator buffer\\nof recent control inputs. The experimental results show that\\nsensing and actuation can have different levels of robustness\\nto packet loss under this design approach. Specifically, while\\nthe plant state observer is highly effective in mitigating the\\neffects of packet loss from the sensors to the controller, the\\ncontrol performance is more sensitive to packet loss from the\\ncontroller to the actuators despite the buffered control inputs.\\nBased on this observation, the paper proposes an asymmetric\\nrouting configuration for sensing and actuation (source routing\\nfor sensing and graph routing for actuation) to improve control\\nperformance.\\n\\n[102] addresses the sampling period optimization with the\\ngoal of minimizing overall control cost while ensuring end-toend delay constraints for a multihop WirelessHART network.\\nThe linear quadratic cost function is used as the control\\nperformance measure, which is a function of the sampling\\nperiod. The optimization problem relies on the multihop\\nproblem formulation of the end-to-end delay bound in [180].\\nDue to the difficulty of the resulting optimization problem,\\nthe solution methodologies based on a subgradient method,\\nsimulated annealing-based penalty method, greedy heuristic\\nmethod and approximated convex optimization method are\\nproposed. The tradeoff between execution time and achieved\\ncontrol cost is analyzed for these methods.\\n2) Event-Triggered Sampling: The communication system\\ndesign for event-triggered sampling has mostly focused on the\\nMAC layer. In particular, most researches focus on contentionbased random access since it is suitable for these control\\nsystems due to the unpredictability of the message generation\\ntime.\\nContention-based Access: The tradeoff between the level\\nthreshold crossings in the control system and the packet losses\\nin the communication system have been analyzed in [204],\\n[211], [206], [207], [208], [209], [210]. [204] studies the eventtriggered control under lossy communication. The information\\nis generated and sent at the level crossings of the plant output.\\nThe packet losses are assumed to have a Bernoulli distribution\\nindependent over each link. The dependence between the\\nstochastic control criterion on the level crossings and the\\nmessage loss probability is derived for a class of integrator\\nplants. This allows the generation of a design guideline on the\\nassignment of the levels for the optimal usage of communication resources.\\n[211] provides an extension to [204] by considering a\\nmulti-dimensional Markov chain model of the attempted and\\nsuccessful transmissions over lossy channel. In particular, a\\nthreshold-based event-triggering algorithm is used to transmit\\nthe control command from the controller to the actuator. By\\ncombining the communication model of the retransmissions\\nwith an analytical model of the closed-loop performance,\\na theoretical framework is proposed to analyze the tradeoff\\nbetween the communication cost and the control performance\\nand it is used to adapt an event threshold. However, the\\nproposed Markov chain only considers the packet loss as\\na Bernoulli process and it does not capture the contention\\nbetween multiple nodes. On the other hand, schedule-based\\naccess, in which the nodes are assigned fixed time slots independent of their message generation times, is considered as an\\nalternative to random access for event-triggered control [81].\\nHowever, this introduces extra delay between the triggering of\\nan event and a transmission in its assigned slot.\\n[206] analyzes the event-based NCS consisting of multiple linear time-invariant control systems over a multichannel\\nslotted ALOHA protocol. The multichannel slotted ALOHA\\nsystem is considered as the random access model of the\\nLong Term Evolution [226]. The authors separate the resource\\nallocation problem of the multichannel slotted ALOHA system\\ninto two problems, namely, the transmission attempt problem\\nand the channel selection problem. Given a time slot, each\\n\\n\f28\\n\\ncontrol loop decides locally whether to attempt a transmission based on some error thresholds. A local threshold-based\\nalgorithm is used to adapt the error thresholds based on the\\nknowledge of the network resource. When the control loop\\ndecides to transmit, then it selects one of the available channels\\nin uniform random fashion.\\nGiven plant and controller dynamics, [207] proposes\\ncontrol-aware random access policies to address the coupling\\nbetween control loops over the shared wireless channel. In\\nparticular, the authors derive a sufficient mathematical condition for the random access policy of each sensor so that it\\ndoes not violate the stability criterion of other control loops.\\nThe authors only assume the packet loss due to the interference\\nbetween simultaneous transmissions of the network. They propose a mathematical condition decoupling the control loops.\\nBased on this condition, a control-aware random access policy\\nis proposed by adapting to the physical plant states measured\\nby the sensors online. However, it is still computationally\\nchallenging to verify the condition.\\nSome event-triggered sampling appproaches [208], [209],\\n[210] use the CSMA protocol to share the network resource.\\n[208] analyzes the performance of the event-based NCSs with\\nthe CSMA protocol to access the shared network. The authors\\npresent a Markov model that captures the joint interactions\\nof the event-triggering policy and a contention resolution\\nmechanism of CSMA. The proposed Markov model basically\\nextends Bianchi’s analysis of IEEE 802.11 [227] by decoupling interactions between multiple event-based systems of the\\nnetwork.\\n[209] investigates the event-triggered data scheduling of\\nmultiple loop control systems communicating over a shared\\nlossy network. The proposed error-dependent scheduling\\nscheme combines deterministic and probabilistic approaches.\\nThis scheduling policy deterministically blocks transmission\\nrequests with lower errors not exceeding predefined thresholds.\\nSubsequently, the medium access is granted to the remaining\\ntransmission requests in a probabilistic manner. The message\\nerror is modeled as a homogeneous Markov chain. The analytical uniform performance bounds for the error variance\\nis derived under the proposed scheduling policy. Numerical\\nresults show a performance improvement in terms of error\\nlevel with respect to the one with periodic and random\\nscheduling policies.\\n[210] proposes a distributed adaptation algorithm for an\\nevent-triggered control system, where each system adjusts\\nits communication parameter and control gain to meet the\\nglobal control cost. Each discrete-time stochastic linear system\\nis coupled by the CSMA model that allows to close only\\na limited number of feedback loops in every time instant.\\nThe backoff intervals of CSMA are assumed to be exponentially distributed with homogeneous backoff exponents.\\nFurthermore, the data packets are discarded after the limited\\nnumber of retransmission trials. The individual cost function\\nis defined as the linear quadratic cost function. The design\\nobjective is to find the optimal control laws and optimal eventtriggering threshold that minimize the control cost. The design\\nproblem is formulated as an average cost Markov Decision\\nProcess (MDP) problem with unknown global system param-\\n\\neters that are to be estimated during execution. Techniques\\nfrom distributed optimization and adaptive MDPs are used\\nto develop distributed self-regulating event-triggers that adapt\\ntheir request rate to accommodate a global resource constraint.\\nIn particular, the dual price mechanism forces each system to\\nadjust their event-triggering thresholds according to the total\\ntransmission rate.\\nSelf-triggered Control and Mixed Approach: Self-triggered\\nsampling allows to save energy consumption and reduce the\\ncontention delay by predicting the level crossings in the future,\\nso, explicitly scheduling the corresponding transmissions [81],\\n[218], [205], [62]. The sensor nodes are set to sleep mode until\\nthe predicted level crossing. [218] proposes a new approach to\\nensure the stability of the controlled processes over a shared\\nIEEE 802.15.4 network by self-triggered control. The selftriggered sampler selects the next sampling time as a function\\nof current and previous measurements, measurement time\\ndelay, and estimated disturbance. The superframe duration and\\ntransmission scheduling in the contention free period of IEEE\\n802.15.4 are adapted to minimize the energy consumption\\nwhile meeting the deadlines. The joint selection of the sampling time of processes, protocol parameters and scheduling\\nallows to address the tradeoff between closed-loop system\\nperformance and network energy consumption. However, the\\ndrawback of this sampling methodology is the lack of its\\nrobustness to uncertainties and disturbances due to the predetermined control and communication models. The explicit\\nscheduling for self-triggered sampling is, therefore, recently\\nextended to include additional time slots in the communication\\nschedule not assigned apriori to any nodes [81]. In the case\\nof the presence of disturbance, these extra slots are used\\nin an event-triggered fashion. The contention-based random\\naccess is used in these slots due to the unpredictability of the\\ntransmissions.\\nIn [205], a joint optimization framework is presented,\\nwhere the objective is a function of process state, cost of\\nthe actuations, and energy consumption to transmit control\\ncommands, subject to communication constraints, limited capabilities of the actuators, and control requirements. While\\nthe self-triggered control is adopted, with the controller dynamically determining the next task execution time of the\\nactuator, including command broadcasting and changing of\\naction, the sensors are assumed to perform sampling periodically. A simulated annealing based algorithm is used for\\nonline optimization, which optimizes the sampling intervals.\\nIn addition, the authors propose a mechanism for estimating\\nand predicting the system states, which may not be known\\nexactly due to packet losses and measurement noise.\\n[62] proposes a joint design approach of control and adaptive sampling for multiple control loops. The proposed method\\ncomputes the optimal control signal to be applied as well\\nas the optimal time to wait before taking the next sample.\\nThe basic idea is to combine the concept of the self-triggered\\nsampling with MPC, where the cost function penalizes the\\nplant state and control effort as well as the time interval until\\nthe next sample is taken. The latter is considered to generate\\nan adaptive sampling scheme for the overall system such that\\nthe sampling time increases as the system state error goes\\n\\n\f29\\n\\nto zero. In the multiple loop case, the authors also present a\\ntransmission scheduling algorithm to avoid the conflicts.\\n[83] proposes a mixed self-triggered sampling and eventtriggered sampling scheme to ensure the control stability of\\nNCSs, while improving the energy efficiency of the IEEE\\n802.15.4 wireless networks. The basic idea of the mixed\\napproach is to combine the self-triggered sampling and the\\nevent-triggered sampling schemes. The self-triggered sampling\\nscheme first predicts the next activation time of the eventtriggered sampler when the controller receives the sensing\\ninformation. The event-triggered sampler then begins to monitor the predefined triggering condition and computes the next\\nsampling instance. Compared to the typical event-triggered\\nsampling, the sensor does not continuously check the eventtriggered condition, since the self-triggered sampling component of the proposed mixed scheme estimates the next\\nsampling a priori. Furthermore, compared with the alone\\nutilization of self-triggered sampling, the conservativeness\\nis reduced, since the event-triggered sampling component\\nextends the sampling interval. By coupling the self-triggered\\nand event-triggered sampling in a unified framework, the\\nproposed scheme extends the inactive period of the wireless\\nnetwork and reduces the conservativeness induced by the selftriggered sampling to guarantee the high energy-efficiency\\nwhile preserving the desired control performance.\\nVIII. E XPERIMENTAL T ESTBEDS\\nIn contrast to previous surveys of WSN testbeds [228],\\n[229], [230], we introduce some of our representative WNCS\\ntestbeds. Existing WNCS research often relies on small-scale\\nexperiments. However, they usually suffers from limited size,\\nand cannot capture delays and losses of realistic large wireless\\nnetworks. Several simulation tools [231], [232], [233] are\\ndeveloped to investigate the NCS research. Unfortunately, simulation tools for control systems often lack realistic models of\\nwireless networks that exhibit complex and stochastic behavior\\nin real-world environments. In this section, we describe three\\nWNCS testbeds, namely, cyber-physical simulator and WSN\\ntestbed, building automation testbed, and industrial process\\ntestbed.\\n\\nFig. 14: WSN testbed in Bryan Hall and Jolley Hall of Washington\\nUniversity in St. Louis.\\n\\nare then fed again into TOSSIM, which delays or drops the\\npackets and sends the outputs to the actuators. Furthermore,\\nit is also possible to use the experimental wireless traces of a\\nWSN testbed as inputs to the TOSSIM simulator.\\nThe Cyber-Physical Laboratory of Washington University in\\nSt. Louis has developed an experimental WSN testbed to study\\nand evaluate WSN protocols [237]. The system comprises a\\nnetwork manager on a server and a network protocol stack\\nimplementation on TinyOS and TelosB nodes [238]. Each\\nnode is equipped with a TI MSP430 microcontroller and a TI\\nCC2420 radio compatible with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.\\nFig. 14 shows the deployment of the nodes in the campus\\nbuilding. The testbed consists of 79 nodes placed throughout\\nseveral office areas. The testbed architecture is hierarchical\\nin nature, consisting of three different levels of deployment:\\nsensor nodes, microservers, and a desktop class host/server\\nmachine. At the lowest tier, sensor nodes are placed throughout\\nthe physical environment in order to take sensor readings\\nand/or perform actuation. They are connected to microservers\\nat the second tier through a USB infrastructure consisting\\nof USB 2.0 compliant hubs. Messages can be exchanged\\nbetween sensor nodes and microservers over this interface in\\nboth directions. In the testbed, two nodes are connected to\\neach microserver, typically with one microserver per room.\\nThe final tier includes a dedicated server that connects to all\\nof the microservers over an Ethernet backbone. The server\\nmachine is used to host, among other things, a database\\ncontaining information about the different sensor nodes and\\nthe microservers they are connected to.\\n\\nA. Cyber-Physical Simulator and WSN Testbed\\nWireless cyber-physical simulator (WCPS) [234] is designed to provide a realistic simulation of WNCS. WCPS\\nemploys a federated architecture that integrates Simulink for\\nsimulating the physical system dynamics and controllers, and\\nTOSSIM [235] for simulating wireless networks. Simulink\\nis commonly used by control engineers to design and study\\ncontrol systems, while TOSSIM has been widely used in\\nthe sensor network community to simulate WSNs based on\\nrealistic wireless link models [236]. WCPS provides an opensource middleware to orchestrate simulations in Simulink and\\nin TOSSIM. Following the software architecture in WCPS, the\\nsensor data generated by Simulink is fed into the WSN simulated using TOSSIM. TOSSIM then returns the packet delays\\nand losses according to the behavior of the network, which are\\nthen fed to the controller of Simulink. Controller commands\\n\\nB. Building Automation Testbed\\nHeating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems\\nguarantee indoor air quality and thermal comfort levels in\\nbuildings, at the price of high energy consumption [39]. To\\nreduce the energy required by HVAC systems, researchers\\nhave been trying to efficiently use thermal storage capacities\\nof buildings by proposing advanced estimation and control\\nschemes by using wireless sensor nodes. An example HVAC\\ntestbed is currently comprised of the second floor of the\\nelectrical engineering building of the KTH campus and is\\ndepicted in Fig. 15. This floor houses four laboratories, an\\noffice room, a lecture hall, one storage room and a boiler\\nroom. Each room of the testbed is considered to be a thermal\\nzone and has a set of wireless sensors and actuators that can\\nbe individually controlled.

Industrial Process Testbed\\n\\nFig. 16: HVAC system architecture. Users are able to design experiments through a LabVIEW application and remotely connect to the\\nHVAC testbed. Additionally, through a web browser any user can\\ndownload experimental data from the testbed database.\\n\\non TinyOS and TelosB nodes [238]. The testbed consists of\\n12 wireless sensors measuring indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, CO2 concentrations, light intensity, occupancy\\nlevels, and events like door/windows openings/closings in\\nseveral rooms. Note that the nodes are equipped with on-board\\nhumidity, temperature, and light sensors, and external sensors\\nsuch as CO2 sensors by using an analog-to-digital converter\\nchannel on the 16-pin Telosb expansion area. Furthermore,\\nlaboratory A225 includes a people counter to measure the\\noccupancy of the laboratory. The collection tree protocol is\\nused to collect the sensor measurements through the multihop\\nnetworks [239]. The actuators are the flow valve of the heating\\nradiator, the flow valve for the air conditioning system, the air\\nvent for fresh air flow at constant temperature, and the air vent\\nfor air exhaust to the corridor.\\nAn overview of the testbed architecture is shown in Fig. 16.\\nThe HVAC testbed is developed in LabVIEW and is comprised\\nof two separate components; the experimental application\\nand a database/web server system [240]. The database is\\nresponsible for logging the data from all HVAC components\\nin real-time. On the other hand, the experimental application is\\ndeveloped by each user and interacts with the data-logging and\\nsupervisory control module in the testbed server, which connects to the programmable logic controller. This component\\nallows for real-time sensing, computation, and actuation. Even\\nthough the application is developed in LabVIEW, MATLAB\\n\\nThe control of liquid levels in tanks and flows between\\ntanks are basic problems in process industry [241]. Liquids\\nneed to be processed by chemicals or mixed treatment in\\ntanks, while the levels of the tanks must be controlled and\\nthe flows between tanks must be regulated. Fig. 17 depicts the\\nexperimental apparatus and a diagram of the physical system\\nused in [81]. The coupled tank system consists of a pump,\\na water basin and two tanks of uniform cross sections [242].\\nThe system is simple, yet representative testbed of dynamics of\\nwater tanks used in practice. The water in the lower tank flows\\nto the water basin. A pump is responsible for pumping water\\nfrom the basin to the upper tank, which then flows to the lower\\ntank. The holes in each of the tanks have the same diameter.\\nThe controller regulates the level of water in the upper or\\nlower tank. The sensing of the water levels is performed by\\npressure sensors placed under each tank. The process control\\ntestbed is built on multiple control systems of Quanser coupled\\ntanks [243] with a wireless network consisting of TelosB\\nnodes. The control loops are regulating two coupled tank\\nprocesses, where the tanks are collocated with the sensors\\nand actuators and communicate wirelessly with a controller\\nnode. A wireless node interfaces the sensors with an analogto-digital converter, in order to sample the sensors for both\\ntanks. The actuation is implemented through the digital-toanalog converter of the wireless actuator node, connected to\\nan amplification circuit that will convert the output voltage of\\nthe pump motor.\\n\\nIX. O PEN C HALLENGES AND\\nF UTURE R ESEARCH D IRECTIONS\\nAlthough a large number of results on WSN and NCSs\\nare reported in the literature, there are still a number of\\nchallenging problems to be solved out, some of them are\\npresented as follows.\\nA. Tradeoff of Joint Design\\nThe joint design of communication and control layers\\nis essential to guarantee the robustness, fault-tolerance, and\\nresilience of the overall WNCS. Several different approaches\\nof WNCS design are categorized dependent on the degree\\nof the interaction. Increasing the interaction may improve\\n\\n\f31\\n\\nthe control performance but at the risk of high complexity\\nof the design problem and thus eventually leading to the\\nfundamental scalability and tractability issues. Hence, it is\\ncritical to quantify the benefit of the control performance and\\ncost of the complexity depending on the design approaches.\\nThe benefit of the adaptation of the design parameters\\nsignificantly depends on the dynamics of control systems.\\nMost researches of control and communication focus on\\nthe design of the controller or the network protocol with\\ncertain optimization problems for the fixed sampling period.\\nSome NCS researches propose possible alternatives to set the\\nsampling periods based on the stability analysis [104], [53],\\n[105]. However, they do not consider the fundamental tradeoff\\nbetween QoS and sampling period of wireless networks. While\\nthe adaptive sampling period might provide control performance improvement, it results in the complex stability problem\\nof the control systems and requires the real-time adaptation of\\nwireless networks. Real-time adaptation of the sampling period\\nmight be needed for the fast dynamical system. On the other\\nhand, it may just increase the complexity and implementation\\noverhead for slow control systems. Hence, it is critical to\\nquantify the benefit and cost of the joint design approach for\\ncontrol and communication systems.\\nB. Control System Requirement\\nVarious technical approaches such as hybrid system,\\nMarkov jump linear system, and time-delay system are used\\nto analyze the stability of NCSs for different network assumptions. The wireless network designers must carefully\\nconsider the detailed assumptions of NCS before using their\\nresults in wireless network design. Similarly, control system\\ndesigners need to consider wireless network imperfections\\nencompassing both message dropout and message delay in\\ntheir framework. While some assumptions of control system\\ndesign affect the protocol operation, other assumptions may\\nbe infeasible to meet for overall network. For instance, the\\nprotocol operation should consider the hard/soft sampling\\nperiod to check whether it is allowed to retransmit the outdated\\nmessages over the sampling period. On the other hand, if the\\nNCS design requires a strict bound on the maximum allowable\\nnumber of consecutive packet losses, this cannot be achieved\\nby the wireless system, in which the packet error probability\\nis non-zero at all times.\\nNumerical methods are mostly used to derive feasible sets\\nof wireless network requirements in terms of message loss\\nprobability and delay to achieve a certain control system\\nperformance. Even though all these feasible requirements meet\\nthe control cost, it may give significantly different network\\ncosts such as energy consumption and robustness and thus\\neventually affect the overall control systems. There are two\\nways to solve these problems. The first one is to provide\\nefficient tools quantifying feasible sets and corresponding\\nnetwork costs. Previous researches of WNCS still lack of the\\ncomparison of different network requirements and their effect\\non the network design and cost. The second one is to provide efficient abstractions of both control and communication\\nsystems enabling the usage of non-numerical methods. For\\n\\ninstance, the usage of stochastic MATI and MAD constraints\\nfor the control system in [4], [190] enables the generation of\\nefficient solution methodologies for the joint optimization of\\nthese systems.\\nC. Communication System Abstraction\\nEfficient abstractions of communication systems need to\\nbe included to achieve the benefit of joint design while\\nreducing complexity for WNCS. Both interactive and joint\\ndesign approaches mostly focus on the usage of constant\\ntransmit power and rate at the physical layer to simplify\\nthe problem. However, variable transmit power and rate have\\nalready been supported by network devices. The integration\\nof the variability of time slots with variable transmit power\\nand rate has been demonstrated to improve the communication\\nenergy consumption significantly [6], [87]. This work should\\nbe extended to integrate power and rate variability into the\\nWNCS design approaches.\\nBernouilli distribution has been commonly used as a packet\\nloss model to analyze the control stability for simplicity. However, most wireless links are highly correlated over time and\\nspace in practice [164], [165]. The time dependence of packet\\nloss distribution can significantly affect the control system\\nperformance due to the effect of consecutive packet losses on\\nthe control system performance. The packet loss dependencies\\nshould be efficiently integrated into the interactive and joint\\ndesign approaches.\\nD. Network Lifetime\\nSafety-critical control systems must continuously operate\\nthe process without any interruptions such as oil refining,\\nchemicals, power plants, and avionics. The continuous operation requires infrequent maintenance shut-downs such as semiannual or annual since its effects of the downtime losses may\\nrange from production inefficiency and equipment destruction\\nto irreparable financial and environmental damages. On the\\nother hand, energy constraints are widely regarded as a fundamental limitation of wireless devices. The limited lifetime\\ndue to the battery constraint is particularly challenging for\\nWNCS, because the sensors/actuators are attached to the main\\nphysical process or equipment. In fact, the battery replacement\\nmay require the maintenance shut-downs since it may be not\\npossible to replace while the control process is operating.\\nRecently, two major technologies of energy harvesting and\\nwireless power transfer have emerged as a promising technology to address lifetime bottlenecks of wireless networks.\\nSome of these solutions are also commercially available and\\ndeployed such as ABB WISA [17] based on the wireless power\\ntransfer for the industrial automation and EnOcean [244]\\nbased on the energy harvesting for the building automation.\\nWNCS using these energy efficient technologies encounters\\nnew challenges at all layers of the network design as well\\nas the overall joint design approach. In particular, the joint\\ndesign approach must balance the control cost and the network\\nlifetime while considering the additional constraint on the\\narrival of energy harvesting. The timing and amount of energy\\nharvesting may be random for the generation of energy from\\n\\n\f32\\n\\nnatural sources such as solar, vibration, or controlled for the\\nRF, inductive and magnetic resonant coupling.\\nE. Ultra-Reliable Ultra-Low Latency Communication\\nRecently, machine-type communication with ultra-reliable\\nand ultra-low latency requirements has attracted much interest in the research community due to many control related\\napplications in industrial automation, autonomous driving,\\nhealthcare, and virtual and augmented reality [245], [246],\\n[247]. In particular, the Tactile Internet requires the extremely\\nlow latency in combination with high availability, reliability\\nand security of the network to deliver the real-time control\\nand physical sensing information remotely [3].\\nDiversity techniques, which have been previously proposed\\nto maximize total data rate of the users, are now being adapted\\nto achieve reliability corresponding to packet error probability\\non the order of 10−9 within latency down to a millisecond or\\nless. The ultra-low latency requirement may prohibit the sole\\nusage of time diversity in the form of automatic-repeat-request\\n(ARQ), where the transmitter resends the packet in the case\\nof packet losses, or hybrid ARQ, where the transmitter sends\\nincremental redundancy rather than the whole packet assuming\\nthe processing of all the information available at the receiver.\\nTherefore, [248], [249], [250], [251] have investigated the\\nusage of space diversity in the form of multiple antennas at\\nthe transmitter and receiver, and transmission from multiple\\nbase stations to the user over one-hop cellular networks. These\\nschemes, however, mostly focus on the reliability of a single\\nuser [248], [251], multiple users in a multi-cell interference\\nscenario [249], or multiple users to meet a single deadline\\nfor all nodes [250]. [252] extended these works to consider\\nthe separate packet generation times and individual packet\\ntransmission deadlines of multiple users in the high reliability\\ncommunication.\\nThe previous work on WNCS only investigated the time\\nand path diversity to achieve very high reliability and very\\nlow latency communication requirements of corresponding\\napplications, as explained in detailed above. The time diversity\\nmechanisms either adopt efficient retransmission mechanisms\\nto minimize the number of bits in the retransmissions at the\\nlink layer or determine the best timing and quantity of time\\nslots given the link quality statistics. On the other hand, path\\ndiversity is based on the identification of multiple disjoint\\npaths from source to destination to guarantee the routing\\nreliability against node and link failures. The extension of\\nthese techniques to include other diversity mechanisms, such\\nas space and frequency in the context of ultra-reliable ultra\\nlow latency communication, requires reformulation of the\\njoint design balancing control cost and network lifetime and\\naddressing new challenges at all layers of the network design.\\nF. Low-Power Wide-Area Networks\\nOne of the major issues for large scale Smart Grid [25],\\nSmart Transportation [26], and Industry 4.0 [12] is to allow\\nlong-range communications of sensors and actuators using\\nvery low-power levels. Recently, several LPWAN protocols\\n\\nsuch as LoRa [23], NB-IoT [24], Sigfox [253], and LTEM [254] are proposed to provide the low data rate communications of battery operated devices. LTE-M and NB-IoT use\\na licensed spectrum supported by 3rd Generation Partnership\\nProject standardization. On the other hand, LoRa and Sigfox\\nrely on an unlicensed spectrum.\\nThe wireless channel behavior of LPWANs is significantly\\ndifferent from the behavior of the short-range wireless channel\\ncommonly used in WNCS standards, such as WirelessHART,\\nBluetooth, and Z-wave, due to different multi-path fading\\ncharacteristics and spectrum usage. Thus, the design of the\\nphysical and link layers is completely different. Moreover, the\\nprotocol design needs to consider the effect of the interoperation of different protocols of LPWANs on the overall message\\ndelay. Hence, the control system engineers must validate the\\nfeasibility of the traditional assumptions of wireless networks\\nfor WNCS based on LPWANs. Furthermore, the network\\narchitecture of LPWAN must carefully adapt its operation\\nin order to support the real-time requirements and control\\nmessage priority of large scale control systems.\\nX. C ONCLUSIONS\\nWireless networked control systems are the fundamental\\ntechnology of the safety-critical control systems in many areas,\\nincluding automotive electronics, avionics, building automation, and industrial automation. This article provided a tutorial\\nand reviewed recent advances of wireless network design\\nand optimization for wireless networked control systems. We\\ndiscussed the critical interactive variables of communication\\nand control systems, including sampling period, message\\ndelay, message dropout, and energy consumption. We then\\ndiscussed the effect of wireless network parameters at all protocol layers on the probability distribution of these interactive\\nvariables. Moreover, we reviewed the analysis and design of\\ncontrol systems that consider the effect of various subsets of\\ninteractive variables on the control system performance. By\\nconsidering the degree of interactions between control and\\ncommunication systems, we discussed two design approaches:\\ninteractive design and joint design. We also describe some\\npractical testbeds of WNCS. Finally, we highlighted major\\nexisting research issues and identified possible future research\\ndirections in the analysis of the tradeoff between the benefit of\\nthe control performance and cost of the complexity in the joint\\ndesign, efficient abstractions of control and communication\\nsystems for their usage in the joint design, inclusion of energy\\nharvesting and diversity techniques in the joint design and\\nextension of the joint design to wide-area wireless networked\\ncontrol systems.\\nR EFERENCES\\n[1] J.

In this article, the projectivity of a finitely generated\\nflat module of a commutative ring is studied through its exterior\\npowers and invariant factors. Consequently, the related results of\\nEndo, Vasconcelos, Wiegand, Cox-Rush and Puninski-Rothmaler\\non the projectivity of f.g. flat modules are generalized.\\n\\n1. Introduction\\nThe main purpose of the present article is to investigate the projectivity of finitely generated flat modules of a commutative ring. It is\\nworthy to mention that this has been the main topic of many articles\\nin the literature over the years and it is still of current interest, see e.g.\\n[1], [2], [4], [6], [7], [8]. Note that in general there are f.g. flat modules\\nwhich are not necessarily projective, see Example 3.17, also see [3, Tag\\n00NY] for another example. We use f.g. in place of “finitely generated”.\\nIn this paper, the projectivity of a finitely generated flat module of\\na commutative ring is studied through its exterior powers and invariant factors. The important outcome of this study is that some major\\nresults in the literature on the projectivity of f.g. flat modules are\\nre-proved directly (e.g. without using the homological methods) and\\nat the same time most of them are vastly generalized. In particular,\\nTheorem 3.10 vastly generalizes [2, Theorem 1], Theorem 3.12 generalizes [7, Theorem 2.1] and Theorem 3.13 generalizes [8, Theorem 2], [1,\\nProposition 2.3], it also generalizes [6, Proposition 5.5 and Corollary\\n5.6] in the commutative case. In fact, Theorem 3.13 can be viewed as\\na generalization of all of the above mentioned results.\\nThe main motivation to investigate the projectivity of f.g. flat modules essentially originates from the fact that “every f.g. flat module\\nover a local ring is free”. In this article we also prove a more general\\nresult, Theorem 3.3. This result, in particular, implies the above fact,\\n0\\n\\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 13C10, 19A13, 13C11, 13E99.\\nKey words and phrases: flat module; invariant factor; projectivity; S-ring.\\n1\\n\\n\f2\\n\\nABOLFAZL TARIZADEH\\n\\nsee Corollary 3.5.\\nFor reading the present article having a reasonable knowledge from\\nthe “exterior powers of a module” is necessary. In this article, all of\\nthe rings are commutative.\\n\\n2. Preliminaries\\nLemma 2.1. Let M be a f.g. R−module, let I = AnnR (M) and let S\\nbe a multiplicative subset of R. Then S −1 I = AnnS −1 R (S −1 M).\\nProof. Easy. \u0003\\nIt is well-known that if R → S is a ring map and M is an R−module\\nthen Λn (M) ⊗R S as S−module is canonically isomorphic to ΛnS (M ⊗R\\nS). It is also well-known that if M is a projective (resp. flat) R−module\\nthen for each natural number n, Λn (M) is a projective (resp. flat)\\nR−module. Finally, if M is a f.g. R−module then Λn (M) is a f.g.\\nR−module. We shall use these facts freely throughout this article.\\n\\n3. Main results\\nLemma 3.1. The annihilator of a f.g. projective module is generated\\nby an idempotent element.\\nProof. Let M be a R−module, let I = AnnR (M) and let J be the\\nideal of R which is generated by the elements f (m) where f : M → R\\nis a R−linear map and m ∈ M. Clearly IJ = 0. Consider a free\\nR−module F with basis {ei } and an onto R−linear map ψ : F → M.\\nFor each i there is a R−linear map hi : F → R such that hi (ej ) = δi,j .\\nIf M is R−projective then there exists a R−linear map ϕ : M → F\\nsuch that ψ ◦ ϕ is the identity map.PPut fi = hi ◦ ϕ for all i. Then\\nfor each m ∈ M we may write m = fi (m)ψ(ei ) where fi (m) = 0 for\\ni\\n\\nall but a finite number of indices i. This implies that JM = M. If\\nmoreover M is a f.g. R−module then, by [3, Tag 00DW], we may find\\nan element b ∈ J such that 1 + b ∈ I. Let a = 1 + b. Then clearly\\na = a2 and I = Ra. \u0003\\n\\n\fNOTES ON FINITELY GENERATED FLAT MODULES\\n\\n3\\n\\nRemark 3.2. In a flat module both of the scalars and vectors involved\\nin a linear relation have very peculiar properties. More precisely, let\\nn\\nP\\nai xi = 0 in M\\nM be a R−module and consider a linear relation\\ni=1\\n\\nwhere ai ∈ R and xi ∈ M for all i. Let I = (a1 , ..., an ) and consider the map ψ : Rn → I which maps each n-tuple (r1 , ..., rn ) of Rn\\nn\\nP\\ninto\\nri ai . Then we get the following exact sequence of R−modules\\ni=1\\n\\nψ⊗1\\n\\ni⊗1\\n\\n/ I ⊗R M where K = Ker ψ. If moreRn ⊗R M\\nn\\nP\\nover M is R−flat then\\nǫi ⊗ xi ∈ Ker(ψ ⊗ 1) where ǫi = (δi,k )1≤k≤n\\n\\nK ⊗R M\\n\\n/\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nfor all i. Because by the flatness of M, I ⊗R M is canonically isomorphic to IM. Therefore there exist a natural number m ≥ 1 and also\\nelements sj = (r1,j , ..., rn,j ) ∈ K and yj ∈ M with 1 ≤ j ≤ m such that\\nn\\nm\\nP\\nP\\nǫi ⊗ xi . Now by applying the canonical isomor(i ⊗ 1)( sj ⊗ yj ) =\\ni=1\\n\\nj=1\\n\\nphism Rn ⊗R M → M n which maps each pure tensor (r1 , ..., rn ) ⊗ x\\nm\\nP\\ninto (r1 x, ..., rn x) we obtain that xi =\\nri,j yj for all i. Moreover for\\neach j,\\n\\nn\\nP\\n\\nj=1\\n\\nri,j ai = 0 since ψ(sj ) = 0.\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nUnder the light of Remark 3.2, the following result is obtained.\\nTheorem 3.3. Let (R, m) be a local ring and let M be a flat R−module.\\nLet S be a subset of M such that its image under the canonical map\\nM → M/mM is linearly independent over k = R/m. Then S is linearly independent over R.\\nProof. Suppose\\n\\nn\\nP\\n\\nai xi = 0 where ai ∈ R and {x1 , ..., xn } ⊆ S.\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nTo prove the assertion we shall use an induction argument on n. If\\nn = 1 then by Remark 3.2, there are elements z1 , ..., zd ∈ M and\\nd\\nP\\nr1 , ..., rd ∈ R such that x1 =\\nrj zj and rj a1 = 0 for all j. By the\\nj=1\\n\\nhypotheses, x1 ∈\\n/ mM. Therefore rj ∈\\n/ m for some j. It follows that\\na1 = 0. Now let n > 1. Again by Remark 3.2, there are elements\\nm\\nn\\nP\\nP\\nri,j yj and\\nri,j ai = 0\\ny1 , ..., ym ∈ M and ri,j ∈ R such that xi =\\nj=1\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nfor all i, j. There is some j such that rn,j ∈\\n/ m since xn ∈\\n/ mM. It\\n\\n\f4\\n\\nABOLFAZL TARIZADEH\\n\\nfollows that an =\\n\\nn−1\\nP\\ni=1\\n\\n−1\\nrn,j\\nri,j ai . Then we get\\n\\nn−1\\nP\\ni=1\\n\\n−1\\nai (xi + rn,j\\nri,j xn ) = 0.\\n\\n−1\\nLet ci = rn,j\\nri,j . Note that the image of {xi + ci xn : 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1}\\nunder the canonical map M → M/mM is linearly independent (because if {x1 , ..., xn } is a linearly independent subset of a module then\\n{xi + ri xn : 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1} is also a linearly independent subset where\\nthe ri are arbitrary scalars). Therefore, by the induction hypothesis,\\nai = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. This also implies that an = 0. \u0003\\n\\nCorollary 3.4. Let (R, m) be a local ring and let M be a flat R−module.\\nThen there is a free R−submodule F of M such that M = F + mM.\\nIn particular, if either M/F is finitely generated or the maximal ideal\\nis nilpotent then M is a free R−module.\\nProof. Every vector space has a basis. So let {xi + mM : P\\ni ∈ I}\\nRxi\\nbe a k-basis of M/mM where k = R/m. By Theorem 3.3, F =\\ni∈I\\n\\nis a free R−module. Clearly M = F + mM. If M/F is finitely generated then by the Nakayama lemma, M = F . If m is nilpotent then\\nthere is a natural number n ≥ 1 such that mn = 0. It follows that\\nM/F = mn (M/F ) = 0. \u0003\\nAs an immediate consequence of the above corollary we obtain the\\nfollowing result which plays a major role in this article:\\nCorollary 3.5. Every f.g. flat module over a local ring is free. \u0003\\nAs a first application of Corollary 3.5 we obtain:\\nLemma 3.6. The annihilator of a f.g. flat module is an idempotent\\nideal.\\nProof. Let M be a f.g. flat module over a ring R. Let I = AnnR (M).\\nLet p be a prime ideal of R. By Lemma 2.1, Ip = AnnRp (Mp ). By\\nCorollary 3.5, Mp is a free Rp −module. Therefore Ip is either the whole\\nlocalization or the zero ideal. If Ip = 0 then (I 2 )p = 0 since I 2 ⊆ I.\\nBut if Ip = Rp then I is not contained in p. Thus we may choose some\\na ∈ I \\ p. Clearly a2 ∈ I 2 \\ p and so (I 2 )p = Rp . Therefore I = I 2 . \u0003\\n\\n\fNOTES ON FINITELY GENERATED FLAT MODULES\\n\\n5\\n\\nIf M is a R−module then the n-th invariant factor of M, denoted by\\nIn (M), is defined as the annihilator\\n\u0001 of the n-th exterior power of M.\\nn\\nTherefore In (M) = AnnR Λ (M) . We have:\\nLemma 3.7. The invariant factors of a f.g. flat module are idempotent ideals.\\nProof. If M is a f.g. flat R−module then Λn (M) is as well. Thus,\\nby Lemma 3.6, In (M) is an idempotent ideal. \u0003\\nRemark 3.8. Let M be a f.g. flat R−module. Then Corollary 3.5\\nleads us to a function ψ : Spec R → N = {0, 1, 2, ...} which is defined\\nas p\\nrankRp (Mp ). It\u0001 is called the rank map of M. It is also easy to\\nsee that Supp Λn (M) = {p ∈ Spec(R) : rankRp (Mp ) ≥ n}.\\nTheorem 3.9. Let M be a f.g. flat R−module. Then the following\\nconditions are equivalent.\\n(i) M is R−projective.\\n(ii) The invariant factors of M are f.g. ideals.\\n(iii) The rank map of M is locally constant.\\nProof. (i) ⇒ (ii) : It is well-known that Λn (M) is a f.g. projective\\nR−module and so by Lemma 3.1, In (M) is a principal ideal.\\n(ii) ⇒ (iii) : It suffices to show that the rank map of M is Zariski\\ncontinuous. By Lemma 3.7 and [3, Tag 00DW], there exists some a ∈\\nIn (M) such that (1 − a)In (M) = 0. Clearly a = a2 and In (M)\u0001 = Ra.\\nBy Remark 3.8, ψ −1 ({n}) = Supp N ∩ Spec(R) \\ Supp N ′ where\\nN = Λn (M) and N ′ = Λn+1\\n\u0001 (M). But Supp N = D(1 − a). Moreover, Supp N ′ = V In+1 (M) since N ′ is a f.g. R−module. Therefore\\nψ −1 ({n}) is an open subset of Spec R.\\n(iii) ⇒ (i) : Apply Corollary 3.5 and [3, Tag 00NX]. \u0003\\nThe following result vastly generalizes [2, Theorem 1].\\nTheorem 3.10. Let A ⊆ B be an extension of rings and let M be a\\nf.g. flat A−module. If M ⊗A B is B−projective then M is A−projective.\\nProof. First we shall prove that I = AnnA (M) is a principal ideal.\\nLet L = AnnB (N) where N = M ⊗A B. We claim that IB = L. Let\\n\\n\f6\\n\\nABOLFAZL TARIZADEH\\n\\nq be a prime ideal of B. Clearly N is a f.g. B−module. Thus, by\\nCorollary 3.5, Lq is either the whole localization or the zero ideal. If\\nLq = 0 then (IB)q = 0 since IB ⊆ L. But if Lq = Bq then L is not\\ncontained in q and so Nq = 0. Again by Corollary 3.5, Ip is either the\\nwhole localization or the zero ideal where p = A ∩ q. If Ip = 0 then\\nMp 6= 0 and so, by Corollary 3.5, Mp ⊗Ap Bq 6= 0. But Mp ⊗Ap Bq\\nis isomorphic to Nq . This is a contradiction. Therefore Ip = Ap . It\\nfollows that (IB)q = Bq . This establishes the claim. By Lemma 3.1,\\nthere is an idempotent e ∈ B such that IB = Be. Let J = B(1−e)∩A.\\nClearly IJ = 0. We have I + J = A. If not, then there exists a prime\\nideal p of A such that I + J ⊆ p. Thus, by Corollary 3.5, Ip = 0.\\nTherefore the extension of IB under the canonical map B → B ⊗A Ap\\nis zero. Thus there exists an element s ∈ A \\ p such that se = 0 and\\nso s = s(1 − e). Hence s ∈ J. But this is a contradiction. Therefore\\nI + J = A. It follows that there is an element c ∈ I such that c = c2\\nand I = Ac. Now, let n ≥ 1. But Λn (M) is a f.g. flat A−module.\\nMoreover, Λn (M) ⊗A B is B−projective since it is canonically isomorphic to ΛnB (M ⊗A B). Thus, by what we have proved above, In (M) is\\na principal ideal. Hence, by Theorem 3.9, M is A−projective. \u0003\\nLemma 3.11. Let M be a f.g. flat R−module and let J be an ideal of\\nR. Let I = AnnR (M) and L = AnnR (M/JM). Then L = I + J.\\nProof. Clearly I + J ⊆ L. Let p be a prime ideal of R. By\\nLemma 2.1, Ip = AnnRp (Mp ). Thus, by Corollary 3.5, Ip is either\\nthe whole localization or the null ideal for all primes p. If Ip = Rp\\nthen (I + J)p = Lp = Rp since I ⊆ I + J ⊆ L. But if Ip = 0 then\\nMp 6= 0 and so AnnRp (Mp /Jp Mp ) = Jp (recall that if F is a nonzero free R−module then AnnR (F/JF ) = J). On the other hand, by\\nLemma 2.1, Lp = AnnRp (Mp /Jp Mp ). Thus (I + J)p = Jp = Lp . Hence\\nL = I + J. \u0003\\nThe following result generalizes [7, Theorem 2.1].\\nTheorem 3.12. Let M be a f.g. flat R−module and let J be an ideal\\nof R which is contained in the radical Jacobson of R. If M/JM is\\nR/J−projective then M is R−projective.\\nProof. First we shall prove that I = AnnR (M) is a principal ideal.\\nBy Lemma 3.11, L = I + J. Also, by Lemma 3.1, AnnR/J (M/JM) =\\n\\n\fNOTES ON FINITELY GENERATED FLAT MODULES\\n\\n7\\n\\nL/J is a principal ideal. This implies that I = Rx + I ∩ J for some\\nx ∈ R since L/J = I + J/J is canonically isomorphic to I/(I ∩ J). But\\nI = Rx. Because let m be a maximal ideal of R. By Corollary 3.5, Im is\\neither the whole localization or the zero ideal. If Im = 0 then (Rx)m = 0\\nsince Rx ⊆ I. But if Im = Rm then I is not contained in m. Thus Rx is\\nalso not contained in m since I ∩ J ⊆ J ⊆ m. Hence (Rx)m = Rm .\\nTherefore I = Rx. Now let n ≥ 1 and let N = Λn (M). Then\\nN/JN is R/J−projective. Because, N/JN as R/J−module is isomorphic to ΛnR/J (M/JM) and ΛnR/J (M/JM) is R/J−projective. But\\nN is a f.g. flat R−module. Therefore, by what we have proved above,\\nIn (M) = AnnR (N) is a principal ideal. Thus the invariant factors of\\nM are f.g. ideals and so by Theorem 3.9, M is R−projective. \u0003\\nA ring R is called an S-ring (“S” refers to Sakhajev) if every f.g. flat\\nR−module is R−projective.\\nTheorem 3.13. Let ϕ : A → B be a ring map whose kernel is contained in the radical Jacobson of A. If M is a f.g. flat A−module such\\nthat M ⊗A B is B−projective then M is A−projective. In particular,\\nif B is an S-ring then A is as well.\\nProof. Clearly M/JM is a f.g. flat A/J−module and M/JM ⊗A/J\\nB ≃ M ⊗A B is B−projective where J = Ker ϕ. Moreover A/J can be\\nviewed as a subring of B via ϕ. Therefore, by Theorem 3.10, M/JM\\nis A/J−projective. Then apply Theorem 3.12. Finally, assume that B\\nis an S-ring. If M is a f.g. flat A−module then M ⊗A B is a f.g. flat\\nB−module and so, by the hypothesis, it is B−projective. Therefore\\nM is A−projective. \u0003\\nRemark 3.14. Let S be a subset of a ring R. The polynomial ring\\nR[xs : s ∈ S] modulo I is denoted by S (−1) R where the ideal I is generated by elements of the form sx2s − xs and s2 xs − s with s ∈ S. We\\ncall S (−1) R the pointwise localization of R with respect to S. Amongst\\nthem, the pointwise localization of R with respect to itself, namely\\nR(−1) R, has more interesting properties; for further information please\\nb instead\\nconsult with [5]. Note that Wiegand [8] utilizes the notation R\\n(−1)\\n2\\nof R\\nR. Clearly η(s) = η(s) (xs + I) and xs + I = η(s)(xs + I)2\\nwhere η : R → S (−1) R is the canonical map and the pair (S (−1) R, η)\\nsatisfies in the following universal property: “for each such pair (A, ϕ)\\nwhere ϕ : R → A is a ring map and for each s ∈ S there is some c ∈ A\\n\\n\f8\\n\\nABOLFAZL TARIZADEH\\n\\nsuch that ϕ(s) = ϕ(s)2 c and c = ϕ(s)c2 then there exists a unique ring\\nmap ψ : S (−1) R → A such that ϕ = ψ ◦ η.” Now let p be a prime\\nideal of R and consider the canonical map π : R → κ(p) where κ(p) is\\nthe residue field of R at p. By the above universal property, there is\\na (unique) ring map ψ : S (−1) R → κ(p) such that π = ψ ◦ η. Thus η\\ninduces a surjection between the corresponding spectra. This, in particular, implies that the kernel of η is contained in the nil-radical of R.\\nUsing this, then the following result vastly generalizes [8, Theorem 2].\\nCorollary 3.15. Let M be a f.g. flat R−module. If there exists a\\nsubset S of R such that M ⊗R S (−1) R is S (−1) R−projective then M is\\nR−projective.\\nProof. It is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.13. \u0003\\nProposition 3.16. Let I be an ideal of a ring R. Then R/I is R−flat\\nif and only if AnnR (f ) + I = R for all f ∈ I.\\nProof. First assume that R/I is R−flat. Suppose there is some\\nf ∈ I such that AnnR (f ) + I 6= R. Thus there exists a prime p of\\nR such that AnnR (f ) + I ⊆ p. Therefore, by Corollary 3.5, Ip = 0\\nand so there is an element s ∈ R \\ p such that sf = 0. But this is\\na contradiction and we win. Conversely, let ϕ : M → N be an injective R−linear map. To prove the assertion it suffices to show that\\nthe induced map M/IM → N/IN given by m + IM\\nϕ(m) + IN\\nn\\nP\\nis injective. If ϕ(m) ∈ IN then we may write ϕ(m) =\\nfi xi where\\ni=1\\n\\nfi ∈ I and xi ∈ N for all i. By the hypothesis, there are elements\\nbi ∈ AnnR (fi ) and ci ∈ I such that 1 = bi + ci . It follows that\\n1 = (b1 + c1 )(b2 + c2 )...(bn + cn ) = b + c where b = b1 b2 ...bn and c ∈ I.\\nThus ϕ(m) = bϕ(m) + cϕ(m) = ϕ(cm). Therefore m = cm ∈ IM. \u0003\\nAs a final result in the following we give an example of a f.g. flat\\nmodule which is not projective. Note that finding explicit examples of\\nf.g. flat modules but not projective is not as easy as one may think at\\nfirst.\\nExample 3.17. Let R =\\n\\nQ\\n\\nA be an infinite direct product of copies of\\nL\\na non-zero ring A and let I =\\nA which is an ideal of R. Let f = (fi )\\ni≥1\\n\\ni≥1\\n\\n\fNOTES ON FINITELY GENERATED FLAT MODULES\\n\\n9\\n\\nbe an element of I. There exists a finite subset D of {1, 2, 3, ...} such\\nthat fi = 0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} \\ D. Now consider the sequences\\ng = (gi ) and h = (hi ) of elements of R with gi = 0 and hi = 1 for\\nall i ∈ D and gi = 1 and hi = 0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} \\ D. Clearly\\ng ∈ AnnR (f ), h ∈ I and 1R = g + h. Thus, by Proposition 3.16, R/I\\nis R−flat. Suppose R/I is R−projective. Then, by Lemma 3.1, there\\nis a sequence e = (ei ) ∈ R such that I = Re. Thus there exists a finite\\nsubset E of {1, 2, 3, ...} such that ei = 0 for all i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} \\ E.\\nClearly {1, 2, 3, ...} \\ E 6= ∅. Pick some k ∈ {1, 2, 3, ...} \\ E. There is\\nsome r = (ri ) ∈ R such that (δi,k )i≥1 = re where δi,k is the Kronecker\\ndelta. In particular, 1A = rk ek = rk 0A = 0A . This is a contradiction.\\nTherefore R/I is not R−projective.\\nReferences\\n[1] Cox, S.H. and Pendleton, R.L. Rings for which certain flat modules are projective. Trans. Amer. Math.

At 2-4 months, infants are able to\\nparse visual inputs in terms of permanent, solid and spatiotemporally continuous objects ([29], [65]). At 6 months,\\nthey understand the notion of stability, support and causality ([63], [6], [5]). Between 8 and 10 months, they grasp the\\nnotions of gravity, inertia, and conservation of momentum\\nin collision; between 10 and 12 months, shape constancy\\n[70], and so on. Such tacit knowledge is intuitive and nonverbal (as opposed to formal knowledge as taught in physics\\nclasses) and follows a developmental path parallel to early\\nlanguage acquisition. Both occur quickly, spontaneously,\\nand without explicit training by caregivers [53].\\nIn living organisms, intuitive physics is a latent construct: it can only be observed and measured indirectly\\nthrough its effects on specific tasks like planning, problem solving, or in humans, verbal descriptions and explanations. It can also be revealed through the measurement of\\nsurprise reactions to ”magic tricks”, i.e., physically impossible events, such as objects disappearing or appearing out\\nof nowhere, passing through each other, or defying gravity\\n([11] for a review). The latent nature of intuitive physics\\nraises two difficult challenges for vision systems: an evaluation challenge and an engineering challenge.\\nThe evaluation challenge can be formulated as follows:\\ngiven an artificial vision system, define a measure which\\nquantifies how much this system understands about (intu-\\n\\nIn order to reach human performance on complex visual\\ntasks, artificial systems need to incorporate a significant\\namount of understanding of the world in terms of macroscopic objects, movements, forces, etc. Inspired by work\\non intuitive physics in infants, we propose an evaluation\\nframework which diagnoses how much a given system understands about physics by testing whether it can tell apart\\nwell matched videos of possible versus impossible events.\\nThe test requires systems to compute a physical plausibility\\nscore over an entire video. It is free of bias and can test a\\nrange of specific physical reasoning skills.

Introduction\\nDespite impressive progress in machine vision on many\\ntasks (face recognition [68], object recognition [33], [26],\\nobject segmentation [52], etc.), artificial systems are still far\\nfrom human-level understanding of complex scenes. Scene\\nunderstanding involves not only segmenting and tracking\\nof objects across time, but also representing the spatial and\\ntemporal relationships between these objects and being able\\n1\\n\\n\fFigure 1: Popular end-to-end applications involving scene understanding and proposed evaluation method based on physical plausibility judgments.\\nitive) physics. One possible answer would be to measure\\nintuitive physics through real-worlds applications like Visual Question Answering (VQA), object tracking or action\\nplanning (see Figure 1). However, this runs into two risks:\\n(a) dataset bias (b) noisy measure. The first risk (also known\\nas the Clever Hans problem [28]), is that real life application datasets often contain inherent statistical biases, which\\nmake it sometimes possible to achieve good performance\\nwith only minimal involvement in solving the problem at\\nhand. The second risk is that the overall performance of a\\nsystem is a complicated function of the performance of its\\nparts; therefore, if a VQA system has a better performance\\nthan another one, it could be, not because it better understands physics, but because it has a better language model.\\nWe propose a framework, which we call the ”physical\\nplausibility test”, which directly evaluates intuitive physics\\nin a task-free and model-free fashion. This framework is inspired by research on infant and animal intuitive physics. It\\nrecasts physical reasoning as a simple yes-no classification\\nproblem: presented with the video of a simple scene, the\\nquestion is whether the depicted event is physically possible or not. The trick is in preparing matched sets of videos\\nwhere the physical violation introduces minimal differences\\nbetween the frames of possible vs impossible movies. By\\nvarying the nature of the physical violation, one can probe\\ndifferent types of reasoning (laws regarding objects and\\ntheir properties, laws regarding objects movement and interactions, etc.).\\nGiven that our method involves videos of events that\\ncould not arise spontaneously in nature, it should be taken\\nas a diagnostic test, and in no way as a practical method for\\ntraining physical reasoning systems. Yet, it’s advantage is\\nthat it can be applied to a variety of systems that have been\\nengineered or trained on some other task, so long as these\\nsystems have the minimal requirement to compute a global\\nscalar number for a given scene, which we can interpret as\\na ’plausibility’ score. Any system based on probability or\\nreconstruction error can easily derive such a score.\\nThe engineering challenge can be formulated as follows:\\n\\nconstruct a system which incorporates as much intuitive\\nphysics as possible (at least as much as infants have, for a\\nstart). We already discarded the use of impossible movies to\\ntrain such a system on the grounds of practicality. Another\\napproach using supervised learning with high level annotations (physical entities, laws or relations, etc.) would also\\nbe impractical. First, a system could have a good physical\\nunderstanding of a scene without performing full 3D reconstruction. Second, as shown by infants, it is possible to learn\\nintuitive physics without being fed with any high level tag\\nor label. In fact, they only experience ’positive’ physical\\ninstances (physically possible events). Additionally, infants\\nget useful feedback from their environment, as they become\\nmore competent at motor control, although such feedback\\nonly consists in possible events. One way to address the\\nchallenge would be therefore to construct an unsupervised\\nor weakly supervised system that learns the laws of physics\\nusing the same type of data available to infants (i.e., abundant amount of observational sensory data, limited but informative environmental feedback, only positive instances).\\nHere, we propose IntPhys, an intuitive physics benchmark which aims at getting a first stab at both the engineering and the evaluation challenges. It consists of synthetic\\nvideos constructed with a python interfaced game engine\\n(UnrealEngine 4), enabling both realistic physics and precise control. The training set consists only of positive cases,\\ni.e. possible movies, as seen from a first-person perspective\\nby an immobile agent. This is probably a more difficult\\ntask than the one faced by infants, because they can explore\\nand interact with their environment. It is however interesting to establish how far one can get with such simplified\\ninputs, which are easy to gather in abundant amounts in the\\nreal world with video cameras. In addition, this enables an\\neasier comparison of models, because they all get the same\\ntraining data. The test set is constructed according to our\\nevaluation framework, i.e., it requires the system to output\\na plausibility score, and is evaluated on its ability to separate possible from impossible movies. The test set can also\\nbe used as a standalone diagnostic evaluation of systems\\ntrained in other ways (real videos, interactive training in a\\nvirtual environment, etc., see [58, 27, 10])\\nThe structure of this paper is as follows: in Section 2,\\nwe review related work in high level vision evaluation and\\nmodels. In Section 3, we detail our intuitive physics evaluation framework. In Section 4, we present the first release of\\nIntPhys Benchmark (V1.0) which addresses the most basic\\ncomponent of intuitive physics, namely object permanence.\\nIn Section 5, we present two baseline systems trained with a\\nframe prediction cost on this dataset only, and analyze their\\nresults compared to human performance.\\n\\n\f2. Related work\\nMost of the previous work relevant for intuitive physics\\nhas been conducted in the context of particular end-to-end\\napplications. We distinguish three broad classes of applications depending on the type of data they use. The first class\\nincludes tasks at the vision-language interface, where a\\nmodel’s ability to reason about an image is assessed through\\na language task (e.g. generating a caption or answering a\\nquestion about the image). The second class includes tasks\\nwhich only use images or videos as input, such as predicting future events in a video or tracking objects through time.\\nThe third class involves vision-action interface, with applications in robotics. In that case, systems require vision reasoning to control actions and predict their outcome.\\n\\n2.1. Vision-Language Interface\\nGoing beyond the standard object classification tasks\\n[62, 33, 26], some of the more recent work in the visionlanguage interface have focused on classifying relations between objects [31, 28]. This requires in principle some understanding of the underlying physics (e.g. the distinction\\nbetween hanging and supporting). Two tasks are currently\\nreceiving a lot of attention: captioning and VQA.\\nScene captioning ([14, 18, 42, 71]) consists in generating\\na sentence that describes an image, or matching an image\\nwith one or several captions. This task requires not only\\nto recognize objects in an image, but also understand spatial relations and interactions between these objects. Visual\\nQuestion Answering ([3, 23, 31, 43, 59, 72, 75]), requires\\nto provide a verbal answer to a verbal question about an image; alternatively, one is only required to rank several potential answers. Like in image captioning, this task requires\\nto understand spatial relations between objects, but in addition it has to understand the question and extract the right\\ninformation to answer it. Some datasets ([66]) use videos\\nas input, instead of static images. Because they go beyond a\\nclosed set of predefined outputs, these two tasks raise evaluation difficulties. As shown in [1] and [73], VQA systems\\ncan ”cheat” and obtain good performance by exploiting statistical biases in the images/questions dataset. For example,\\nif the question ”What covers the ground?” is highly correlated with images of snow-covered ground, a statistical\\nlearner would perform well on that question by always answering snow, whatever the image. These biases make it\\nharder to understand models’ weaknesses and strengths.\\nIn the CLEVR dataset [28], authors focus on testing visual reasoning ability while minimizing questionconditional biases. They provide ground-truth representations for both images and questions, as well as detailed annotations describing the kind of reasoning each question requires. In a similar spirit, we aim to propose a diagnostic tool for visual reasoning systems, providing systematically constructed tasks minimizing statistical biases. Our\\n\\nproposed task gets rid of language altogether and directly\\ntaps into understanding of objects and their interactions.\\n\\n2.2. High level Vision\\nMany research projects in vision define tasks which aim\\nat recovering high level structure from low level (pixel) information. One example is the recovery of 3D structure\\nfrom static or moving images ([12, 64, 69, 15, 60]). Two\\ntasks have been proposed to tackle the temporal dynamics\\nof objects in videos: object tracking and future prediction.\\nClassic formulations of object tracking focus on matching instance labels through video frames. For a given video,\\nit results in a collection of object instances, with their location at every time step. This is a well-studied problem with\\nits own literature [51, 44, 55, 9] and challenges [32, 34].\\nContrary to learning systems, hand-crafted tracking models\\nuse priors regarding objects motion, assuming for instance\\nthat objects have constant speed when they are occluded, or\\nthat their appearance only have small changes through time.\\n\\n2.3. Intuitive Physics and Forward Modelling\\nPrediction can be seen as a more general task than object tracking. Given an image, or a stack of images around\\ntime t, the task is to produce a predicted image some time\\nin the future. Recent studies have investigated models for\\npredicting the stability and forward modeling the dynamics of towers of blocks ([8, 35, 74, 39, 46, 40]). [8] proposes a model based on an intuitive physics engine, [35]\\nand [39] follow a supervised approach using Convolutional\\nNeural Networks (CNNs), [74] makes a comparison between simulation-based models and CNN-based models,\\n[46] improves the predictions of a CNN model by providing\\nit with a prediction of a generative model. In [45], authors\\npropose different feature learning strategies (multi-scale architecture, adversarial training method, image gradient difference loss function) to predict future frames in raw videos.\\nEven though next frame prediction tasks could be used to\\nlearned aspects of intuitive physics through observed regularities of object motion, current pixel-based forward models still struggle to predict outcomes beyond a few frames.\\nOther models use more structured representation of objects to derive longer-term predictions. In [7] and [13], authors learn objects dynamics by modelling their pairwise\\ninteractions and predicting the resulting objects states representation (e.g. position / velocity / object intrinsic properties) . In [67], [21] and [17] authors combine factored latent\\nobject representations, object centric dynamic models and\\nvisual encoders. Each frame is parsed into a set of object\\nstate representations, which are used as input of a dynamic\\nmodel. In [21] and [17], authors use a visual decoder to\\nreconstruct the future frames, allowing the model to learn\\nfrom raw (though synthetic) videos.\\n\\n\f2.4. Vision-Action Interface\\nOther studies have focused on vision-action interface,\\nwith potential applications in robotics. The main tasks are\\nof two kinds: i) predicting the outcome of an action in a\\nvisual environment (forward modelling) and ii) predicting\\nthe optimal action to make in order to reach the desired outcome (action planning).\\nForward modelling has been studied in [19], where authors train a model to predict the outcome of interactions\\nbetween a robot and an object. Conditioned with an input\\nimage, the state and the action of the robot, their model is\\ntrained to predict the resulting image after the action. In\\n[20] they use this forward model to train the robot to execute a given action on an object. In [49], authors construct\\n10355 indoor scenes in a physics simulator and apply forces\\nto various objects in these scenes. They train a deep neural\\nnetwork to predict effects of forces on objects, the ground\\ntruth being simulated by the physics simulator, using properties like mass, friction, gravity and solidity. In [48], they\\ntrain a model to predict the dynamics of object from static\\nimages.\\nOther studies focused on learning control from visual inputs. In [54] and [38], authors train deep neural networks\\nto coordinate robotic vision and action, on the specific task\\nof object grasping. Learning visual control policies with\\nreinforcement learning has been investigated either in simulation ([41]) or in the real world [37]. Some systems use a\\nprediction model in the purpose of action planning. In [50],\\nauthors train a model to predict future frames in videos,\\nusing these predictions to train a Q-controller for playing\\nAtari games. Integrating a model of the dynamic of the\\nexternal world to an agent was also done in [25], to plan\\nnovel actions by running multiple internal simulations. Finally, robots pushing (”poking”) objects was investigated in\\n[2], where the model does not predict the image directly\\nbut rather a latent representation of it. This latent representation and the forward model are learned jointly with an\\ninverse model that predicts how to move the object to a desired position, so that the latent representation has to keep\\ninformation about object location. Being able to manipulate\\nobjects or predict dynamics in billiard game ([22]) seems to\\nrequire notions like solidity, mass, collisions and causality.\\nEven though the proposed framework for testing intuitive\\nphysics involves vision only, integrating vision and action\\nduring training may help to learn these notions.\\n\\n3. A diagnostic test for intuitive physics\\nAs we just saw, there is a great diversity of systems and\\napplications that rely in some way or other on physical understanding. We propose a single diagnostic test which can\\nbe run (provided minor modifications) on any of these systems (captioning and VQA systems, systems performing 3D\\n\\nreconstruction, tracking, planning, etc), be they engineered\\nby hand or trained using statistical learning. The main idea\\nis to draw from work in developmental or comparative psychology (infants or animals), to construct a well controlled\\ntest avoiding potential statistical biases and cheap tricks,\\nand to obtain relatively pure tests measuring different types\\nof physical reasoning abilities.\\nIntuitive physics is best described at the latent body of\\nknowledge which allow organisms to predict events and\\nplan actions and, when applicable, describe them. This\\nbody of knowledge may be incomplete, not totally coherent,\\nand not used in all situations due to variations in attention,\\nmemory etc. Here, we will take the view that it is a rudimentary version of Newtonian physics, in so far as it deals\\nwith solid macroscopic objects existing in a 3D world with\\ntheir intrinsic properties (mass, shape, position, velocities,\\netc.).\\nWe illustrate our diagnostic test on object permanence,\\none of the most basic principle of intuitive physics which\\nstates that an object continue to exist even when not seen.\\nWe present the design features of our test: minimal sets,\\nparametric task difficulty, and evaluation metric. We then\\nshow how this can be extended to a wide range of intuitive\\nphysics reasoning problems.\\n\\n3.1. Minimal sets design\\nAn important design principle of our evaluation framework relates to the organization of the possible and impossible movies in extremely well matched sets to avoid the\\nClever Hans problem. This is illustrated in Figure 2 for\\nobject permanence. We constructed matched sets comprising four movies, which contain an initial scene at time t1\\n(either one or two objects), and a final scene at time t2 (either one or two objects), separated by a potential occlusion\\nby a screen which is raised and then lowered for a variable\\namount of time. At its maximal height, the screen completely occludes the objects so that it is impossible to know\\nin this frame how many objects are behind the occluder.\\nThe four movies are constructed by combining the two\\npossible beginnings with the two possible endings, giving\\nrise to two possible (1→1 and 2→2) and two impossible (1→2 and 2→1) movies. Importantly, across these 4\\nmovies, the possible and impossible ones are made of the\\nexact same frames, the only factor distinguishing them being the temporal coherence of these frames. Such a design\\nis intended to make it difficult for algorithms to use cheap\\ntricks to distinguish possible from impossible movies by focusing on low level details, but rather requires models to focus on higher level temporal dependencies between frames.\\n\\n3.2. Parametric manipulation of task complexity\\nOur second design principle is that in each block, we will\\nvary the stimulus complexity in a parametric fashion. In the\\n\\n\f3.4. A hierarchy of intuitive physics problems\\n\\nFigure 2: Illustration of the minimal sets design with object permanence. Schematic description of a static condition with one vs.\\ntwo objects and one occluder. In the two possible movies (green\\narrows), the number of objects remains constant despite the occlusion. In the two impossible movies (red arrows), the number of\\nobjects changes (goes from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 1).\\n\\ncase of the object permanence block, for instance, stimulus complexity can vary according to three dimensions. The\\nfirst dimension is whether the change in number of objects\\noccurs in plain view (visible) or hidden behind an occluder\\n(occluded). A change in plain view is evidently easier to detect whereas a hidden change requires an element of short\\nterm memory in order to keep a trace of the object’s through\\ntime. The second dimension is the complexity of the object’s motion. Tracking an immobile object is easier than if\\nthe object has a complicated motion. The third dimension\\nis the number of objects involved in the scene. This tests\\nfor the attentional capacity of the system as defined by the\\nnumber of objects it can track simultaneously. Manipulating stimulus complexity is important to establish the limit\\nof what a vision system can do, and where it will fail. For\\ninstance, humans are well known to fail when the number of\\nobjects to track simultaneously is greater than four ([56]).\\n\\n3.3. The physical possibility metrics\\nOur evaluation metrics depend on the system’s ability to\\ncompute a plausibility score P (x) given a movie x. Because\\nthe test movies are structured in N matched k-uplets (in\\nFigure 2, k = 4) of positive and negative movies Si=1..N =\\n{P os1i ..P oski , Imp1i ..Impki }, we derive two different metrics. The relative error rate LR computes a score within\\neach set. It requires only that within a set, the positive\\nmovies are more plausible than the negative movies.\\n1 X P\\nLR =\\n1 j P (P osji )<Pj P (Impji )\\n(1)\\nN i\\nThe absolute error rate LA requires that globally, the\\nscore of the positive movies is greater than the score of the\\nnegative movies. It is computed as:\\nLA = 1 − AU C({i, j; P (P osji )}, {i, j; P (Impji )}) (2)\\nWhere AU C is the Area Under the ROC Curve, which\\nplots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at\\nvarious threshold settings.\\n\\nWe now explain how the design principles we presented\\nabove can be applied to study physical reasoning with progressively more complicated problems. Taking advantage\\nof behavioral work on intuitive studies [4], we organize the\\ntests into levels and blocks, each one corresponding to a\\ncore principle of intuitive physics, and each raising its particular machine vision challenge. Our typology of problems\\nis presented in Table 1. It is organized in two levels: at the\\nlevel 1, the problems only deal with properties and movement characteristics of single objects. At the level 2, the\\nproblems involve interactions between objects.\\nIn the first level, we define 5 blocks as follows. The first\\ntwo are related to the conservation through time of intrinsic properties of objects. Object permanence (O1), already\\ndiscussed, corresponds to the fact that objects continuously\\nexist through time and do not pop in or out of existence.\\nThis turns into the computational challenge of tracking objects through occlusion. The second block, shape constancy\\n(O2) describes the tendancy of rigid objects to preserve their\\nshape through time. This principle is more challenging than\\nthe preceding one, because even rigid objects undergo a\\nchange in appearance due to other factors (illumination, distance, viewpoint, partial occlusion, etc.). The other three\\nblocks (O3-5) relate to object’s movement through time,\\nand the conservation laws which govern these movements\\nfor rigid inanimate macroscopic objects. These principles\\nmap into progressively more challenging problems of trajectory prediction.\\nRegarding the interactions between objects (level 2), we\\nalso define 5 blocs, in increasing order of complexity. The\\nfirst two test for very basic principles. Solidity (I1) states\\nthat two objects cannot occupy the same physical space.\\nCausality (I2) states that object’s interactions can only occur\\nthrough physical contact. This is of course not true for gravitational and electromagnetic forces, but still the principle of\\ncontact is deeply entrenched in human perception [36, 61].\\nFurther, forces acting at a distance would have limited practical value for many applications, another reason to leave\\nthem for further extensions. The last three blocks (I3-5) correspond to modes of interactions between objects through\\ncontact (elastic collision, support and containment). All of\\nthese blocks raise difficult challenges for action planning,\\nand some of them also for correctly describing a scene or\\nan event using language (causality, support, containment).\\n\\n4. The IntPhys Benchmark (V1.0)\\nWe present the first release of IntPhys, a benchmark designed to address both the engineering and evaluation challenges for intuitive physics in vision systems. This first release (V1.0) is focused on unsupervised learning, and tests\\nonly the first Block of our hierarchy of problems (O1, ob-\\n\\n\fTable 1: List of the conceptual blocks of the Intuitive Physics Framework.\\nBlock Name\\nO1.

Future releases will include more of the\\nblocks of Table 1.\\nThe benchmark consists of three components: (1) a training set containing only physically possible events involving\\nsimple inanimate objects moving and interacting in a virtual\\nenvironment - (2) a dev and test set containing both physically possible and physically impossible videos, carefully\\nmatched in tuples as described above - (3) an evaluation\\nsoftware. We describe these three components, as well as\\nthe results of humans plausibility judgments on the test set,\\nwhich can serve as a reference for algorithms modeling human perception.\\n\\n4.1. The training set\\nThe training set has been constructed using Unreal Engine 4.0; it contains a large variety of objects interacting\\none with another, occluders, textures, etc. See Figure 3 for\\nsome examples. It is composed of 15K videos of possible\\nevents (around 7 seconds each at 15fps), totalling 21 hours\\nof videos. Each video is delivered as stacks of raw image\\n(288 x 288 pixels), totalling 157Gb of uncompressed data.\\nWe also release the source code for data generation, allowing users to generate a larger training set if desired.\\nEven though the spirit of IntPhys is the unsupervised\\nlearning of intuitive physics, we do provide additional information which may help the learner. The first one is the\\ndepth field for each image. This is not unreasonable, given\\nthat in infants, stereo vision and motion cues could provide\\nan approximation of this information. We also deliver object instance segmentation masks. Given that this information it is probably not available as such in infants, we provide it only in the training set, not in the test set, for pretraining purposes.\\n\\nFigure 3: Examples of frames from the training set.\\n\\n4.2. The dev and test sets\\nThis section describes the dev and test sets for block\\nO1 (object permanence). The design of these dev and test\\nsets follow the general structure of matched sets described\\nin section 3.2. As for parametric complexity, we vary the\\nnumber of objects (1, 2 or 3), the presence and absence of\\noccluder(s) and the complexity of the movement (static, dynamic 1 and dynamic 2). In the static case, the objects do\\nnot move; in the dynamic 1 case, they bounce or roll from\\nleft to right or right to left. In both these types of events,\\none occluder may be present on the scene, and objects may\\nsometimes pop into existence (a 0→1 event), or disappear\\nsuddenly (1→0) - these impossible events occur behind the\\noccluder when it is present, or in full view otherwise. In\\ndynamic 2 events (illustrated in Supplementary Material,\\nFigure 4), two occluders are present and the existence of\\nobjects may change twice. For example, one object may\\nbe present on the scene at first, then disappear after going\\nbehind the first occluder, later reappearing behind the sec-\\n\\n\fond occluder (1→0→1). Dynamic 2 events were designed\\nto prevent systems from detecting inconsistencies merely\\nby comparing the number of objects visible at the beginning and at the end of the movie. Matched sets contain four\\nvideos: two possible events (0→0→0 and 1→1→1) and\\ntwo impossible events (0→1→0 and 1→0→1).\\nIn total, the Block O1 test set contains 18 types of movies\\n(3 objects, 2 occlusions and 3 types of movements). The\\ndev set is instantiated by 20 different renderings of these 18\\nscenarios, objects positions, shapes, trajectories, resulting\\nin 360 movies. The test set is instantiated by 200 different\\nrenderings of these scenarios (for a total of 3600 movies)\\nand uses different objects, textures, motions, etc. All of the\\nobjects and textures of the dev and test sets are present in\\nthe training set.\\nThe purpose of the dev set released in IntPhys V1.0 is\\nto help in the selection of an appropriate plausibility score,\\nand in the comparison of various architectures (hyperparameters), but it should not serve to train the model’s parameters (this should be done only with the training set).\\nThis is why the dev set is kept intentionally small. The test\\nset has more statistical power and enables a fine grained\\nevaluation of the results across the different movie subtypes.\\n\\n4.3. Evaluation software\\nFor each movie, the model should issue a scalar plausibility score. This number together with the movie ID is then\\nfed to the evaluation software which outputs two tables of\\nresults, one for the absolute score and the other for the relative score.\\nThe evaluation software is provided for the dev set, but\\nnot the test set. For evaluating on the test set, participants are invited to submit their system and results (see\\nwww.intphys.com) and their results will be registered\\nand time-stamped on the website leaderboard.\\n\\n4.4. Human Judgments\\nWe presented the 3600 videos from the test set (Block\\nO1) to human participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk.\\nThe experiment and human judgements results are detailed\\nin Supplementary Section 8.\\n\\n5. Baseline Systems\\nIn this section, we present two baseline systems which\\nattempt to learn intuitive physics in an unsupervised setting,\\ni.e., using only the possible movies of the training set. The\\ntwo baselines consist in training deep neural networks with\\na future frame prediction objective.\\nBased on the literature on next frame prediction, we propose two neural network models, predicting a future frame\\ngiven a set of current frames. Our first model has a CNN\\nencoder-decoder structure and the second is a conditional\\n\\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN, [24]), with a similar structure as DCGAN ([57]). For both model architectures, we investigate two different training procedures: in\\nthe first, we train models to predict short-future images with\\na prediction span of 5 frames; in the second, we predict\\nlong-future images with a prediction span of 35 frames.\\nPreliminary work with predictions at the pixel level revealed that our models failed at predicting convincing object motions, especially for small objects on a rich background. For this reason, we switched to computing predictions at a higher level, using object masks. We use the metadata provided in the benchmark training set to train a semantic mask Deep Neural Network (DNN). This DNN uses\\na resnet-18 pretrained on Imagenet to extract features from\\nthe image, from which a deconvolution network is trained\\nto predict the semantic mask which only distinguished three\\ntypes of entities: background, occluders and objects. We\\nthen use this mask as input to a prediction component which\\npredicts future masks based on past ones.\\nTo evaluate these models on our benchmark, our system\\nneeds to output a plausibility score for each movie. For this,\\nwe compute the prediction loss along the movie. Given past\\nframes, a plausibility score for the frame ft can be derived\\nby comparing ft with the prediction fˆt . Like in [22], we\\nuse the analogy with an agent running an internal simulation\\n(visual imagination); here we assimilate a greater distance\\nbetween prediction and observation with a lower plausibility. In subsection 5.2 we detail how we aggregate the scores\\nof all frames into a plausibility score for the whole video.\\n\\n5.1. Models\\nThrough out the movie, our models take as input two\\nframes (fi1 , fi2 ) and predict a future frame ftarget . The\\nprediction span is independent from the model’s architecture and depends only on the triplets (fi1 , fi2 , ftarget )\\nprovided during the training phase. Our two architectures\\nare trained either on a short term prediction task (5 frames\\nin the future), or a long term prediction task (35 frames).\\nIntuitively, short-term prediction will be more robust,\\nbut long-term prediction will allow the model to grasp\\nlong-term dependencies and deal with long occlusions.\\nCNN encoder-decoder We use a resnet-18 ([26]) pretrained on Imagenet ([62]) to extract features from input\\nframes (fi1 , fi2 ). A deconvolution network is trained\\nto predict the semantic mask of future frame ftarget\\nconditioned to these features, using a L2 loss.\\nGenerative Adversarial Network As a second baseline,\\nwe propose a conditional generative adversarial network\\n(GAN, [47]) that takes as input predicted semantic masks\\nfrom frames (fi1 , fi2 ), and predicts the semantic mask of\\nfuture frame ftarget . In this setup, the discriminator has to\\ndistinguish between a mask predicted from ftarget directly\\n\\n\f(real), and a mask predicted from past frames (fi1 , fi2 ).\\nLike in [16], our model combines a conditional approach\\nwith a similar structure as of DCGAN [57]. At test time,\\nwe derive a plausibility score by computing the conditioned\\ndiscriminator’s score for every conditioned frame. This is\\na novel approach based on the observation that the optimal\\ndiscriminator D computes a score for x of\\nPdata (x)\\n(3)\\nD(x) =\\nPG (x) + Pdata (x)\\nFor non-physical events x̂, Pdata (x̂) = 0; therefore, as\\nlong as PG (x̂) > 0, D(x̂) should be 0 for non-physical\\nevents, and D(x) > 0 for physical events x. Note that this\\nis a strong assumption, as there is no guarantee that the generator will ever have support at the part of the distribution\\ncorresponding to impossible videos.\\nAll our models’ architectures, as well as training procedures and samples of predicted semantic masks can be\\nfound in Supplementary Material (Tables 3, 4, 5, 6 and Figure 6). The code will be made available.\\n\\n5.2. Video Plausibility Score\\nFrom forward models presented above, we can compute\\na plausibility score for every frame ftarget , conditioned to\\nprevious frames (fi1 , fi2 ). However, because the temporal positions of impossible events are not given, we must\\ndecide of a score for a video, given the scores of all its conditioned frames. An impossible event can be characterized\\nby the presence of one or more impossible frame(s), conditioned to previous frames. Hence, a natural approach to\\ncompute a video plausibility score is to take the minimum\\nof all conditioned frames’ scores:\\nPlaus(v) =\\n\\nmin\\n(fi1 ,fi2 ,ftarget )∈v\\n\\nPlaus(ftarget |fi1 , fi2 )\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nwhere v is the video, and (fi1 , fi2 , ftarget ) are all the\\nframe triplets in v, as given in the training phase.\\n\\n5.3. Results\\nShort-term prediction The first training procedure is a\\nshort-term prediction task; it takes as input frames ft−2 , ft\\nand predicts ft+5 , which we note (ft−2 , ft ) → ft+5 in the\\nfollowing. We train the two architectures presented above\\non short-term prediction task and evaluate them on the\\ntest set. For the relative classification task, CNN encoderdecoder has an error rate of 0.10 when impossible events\\nare visible and 0.53 when they are occluded. The GAN has\\nan error rate of 0.12 when visible and 0.48 when occluded.\\nFor the absolute classification task, CNN encoder-decoder\\nhas a LA (see eq. 2) of 0.31 when impossible events are\\nvisible and 0.50 when they are occluded. The GAN has a\\nLA of 0.27 when visible and 0.51 when occluded. Results\\nare detailed in Supplementary Material (Tables 7, 8, 9, 10).\\n\\nWe observe that our short-term prediction models show\\ngood performances when the impossible events are visible,\\nespecially on the relative classifications task. However\\nthey perform poorly when the impossible events are\\noccluded. This is easily explained by the fact that they have\\na prediction span of 5 frames, which is usually lower than\\nthe occlusion time. Hence, these models don’t have enough\\n”memory” to catch occluded impossible events.\\nLong-term prediction The second training procedure\\nconsists in a long-term prediction task: (ft−5 , ft ) → ft+35 .\\nFor the relative classification task, CNN encoder-decoder\\nhas an error rate of 0.19 when impossible events are visible\\nand 0.49 when they are occluded. The GAN has an error\\nrate of 0.20 when visible and 0.43 when occluded. For the\\nabsolute classification task, CNN encoder-decoder has a\\nLA of 0.43 when impossible events are visible and 0.50\\nwhen they are occluded. The GAN has a LA of 0.33 when\\nvisible and 0.50 when occluded. Results are detailed in\\nSupplementary Material (Tables 11, 12, 13, 14).\\nAs expected, long-term models perform better than shortterm models on occluded impossible events. Moreover,\\nresults on absolute classification task confirm that it is\\nway more challenging than the relative classification task.\\nBecause some movies are more complex than others, the\\naverage score of each quadruplet of movies may vary a\\nlot. It results in cases where one model returns a higher\\nplausibility score to an impossible movie M{imp, easy} from\\nan easy quadruplet than to a possible movie M{pos, complex}\\nfrom a complex quadruplet.\\nAggregated model To grasp short and long-term dependencies, we aggregate the scores of short-term and longterm models: Pagg (v) = (Pshort-term (v) + Plong-term (v))/2.\\nFor the relative classification task, CNN encoder-decoder\\nhas an error rate of 0.14 when impossible events are visible\\nand 0.51 when they are occluded. The GAN has an error\\nrate of 0.12 when visible and 0.51 when occluded. For the\\nabsolute classification task, CNN encoder-decoder has a LA\\nof 0.35 when impossible events are visible and 50 when they\\nare occluded. The GAN has a LA of 0.27 when visible and\\n0.51 when occluded. Results are detailed in Supplementary\\nMaterial (Tables 15, 16, 17, 18, Figure 10).\\n\\n6. Discussion\\nWe defined a general framework for measuring intuitive\\nphysics in artificial systems inspired by research on conceptual development in infants. In this framework, a system\\nis asked to return a plausibility score for a video sequence\\nshowing physical interaction between objects. The system’s\\nperformance is assessed by measuring its ability to discriminate possible from impossible videos illustrating several\\ntypes of physical principles. In addition we present IntPhys:\\n\\n\fa benchmark designed to test for the unsupervised learning of intuitive physics (learning from positive examples\\nonly). On the first release of this benchmark (V1.0), dedicated to object permanence, we provide both human performance and proof of principle baseline systems. Humans\\nshow a generally good performance, although some attentional limitations start to appear when using occlusion and\\nseveral objects to track simultaneously. The computational\\nsystem shows that it is possible to obtain above chance performance using a mask prediction task, although occlusion\\npresents a particularly strong challenge.\\nThe relative success of the mask prediction system\\ncompared to what can be expected from pixel-based systems indicates that operating at a more abstract level is\\na worth pursuing strategy. As new blocks of the Benchmark are released (see Table 1), the prediction task will become more and more difficult and progressively reach the\\nlevel of scene comprehension achieved by one-year-old humans.\\n\\nReferences\\n[1] A.

Framework details\\n\\nties was reversed, presumably because participants started\\nusing heuristics, such as checking that the number of objects at the beginning is the same as at the end, and therefore\\nmissed the intermediate disappearance of an object.\\nThese results suggest that human participants are not responding according to the gold standard laws of physics due\\nto limitations in attentional capacity - and this, even though\\nthe number of objects to track is below the theoretical limit\\nof 4 objects. The performance of human observers can thus\\nserve as a reference besides ground truth, especially for systems intended to model human perception.\\n\\n9. Models and training procedure\\nFigure 4: Illustration of the ’dynamic 2’ condition. In the\\ntwo possible movies (green arrows), the number of objects\\nremains constant despite the occlusion. In the two impossible movies (red arrows), the number of objects changes\\ntemporarily (goes from 0 to 1 to 0 or from 1 to 0 to 1).\\n\\n9.1.

Human Judgement - Experiment\\nWe presented the 3600 videos from the test set (Block\\nO1) to human participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk.\\nParticipants were first presented 8 examples of possible\\nscenes from the training set, some simple, some more complex. They were told that some of the test movies were\\nincorrect or corrupted, in that they showed events that could\\nnot possibly take place in the real world (without specifying how). Participants were each presented with 40 randomly selected videos, and labeled them as POSSIBLE or\\nIMPOSSIBLE. They completed the task in about 7 minutes,\\nand were paid $1. A response was counted as an error when\\na possible movie was classified as impossible or vice versa.\\nA total of 346 persons participated, but for 99 of them the\\ndata were discarded because they failed to respond 100%\\ncorrectly to the easiest condition, i.e., static, one object,\\nvisible. A mock sample of the AMT test is available in\\nhttp://129.199.81.135/naive physics experiment.\\nThe average error rates were computed across condition,\\nnumber of objects and visibility for each remaining participant and are shown in Table 2. The overall error rate was\\nrather low (16.5%), but, in general, observers missed violations more often when the scene was occluded. There was\\nan increase in error going from static to dynamic 1 and from\\ndynamic 1 to dynamic 2, but this pattern was only consistently observed in the occluded condition. For visible scenario, the dynamic 1 appeared more difficult than the dynamic 2. This was probably due to the fact that when objects\\nare visible, the dynamic 2 impossible scenarios contain two\\nlocal discontinuities and are therefore easier to spot than\\nwhen one discontinuity only is present. When the discontinuities occurred behind the occluder, the pattern of difficul-\\n\\nWe separate 10% of the training dataset to control the\\noverfitting of our forward predictions. All our models are\\ntrained using Adam [30]. For the CNN encoder-decoder we\\nuse Adam’s default parameters and stop the training after\\none epoch. For the GAN, we use the same parameters as\\nin [57]: we set the generator’s learning rate to 8e − 4 and\\ndiscriminator’s learning rate to 2e − 4. On the short-term\\nprediction task, we train the GAN for 1 epoch; on the longterm prediction task we train it for 5 epochs. Learning rate\\ndecays are set to 0 and beta1 is set to 0.5 for both generator\\nand discriminator.\\n\\n10.

The idea that alignment could be avoided was\\nsuggested by Adams but no process for achieving this aim has been described before.\\n1998 ACM Subject Classification D.3.1 Formal Definitions and Theory; D.3.4 Processors; F.4.2\\nGrammars and Other Rewriting Systems\\nKeywords and phrases Parsing expression grammars, indentation, grammar transformation\\n\\n1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nParsing expression grammars (PEG) introduced by Ford [6] serve as a modern framework\\nfor specifying the syntax of programming languages and are an alternative to the classic\\ncontext-free grammars (CFG). The core difference between CFG and PEG is that descriptions\\nin CFG can be ambiguous while PEGs are inherently deterministic. A syntax specification\\nwritten in PEG can in principle be interpreted as a top-down parser for that syntax; in the\\ncase of left recursion, this treatment is not straightforward but doable (see, e.g., [8]).\\nFormally, a PEG is a quadruple G = (N, T, δ, s) where:\\nN is a finite set of non-terminals;\\nT is a finite set of terminals;\\nδ is a function mapping each non-terminal to its replacement (corresponding to the set\\nof productions of CFG);\\ns is the start expression (corresponding to the start symbol of CFG).\\nSo δ : N → EG and s ∈ EG , where the set EG of all parsing expressions writable in G is\\ndefined inductively as follows:\\n1. ε ∈ EG (the empty string);\\n2. a ∈ EG for every a ∈ T (the terminals);\\n3. X ∈ EG for every X ∈ N (the non-terminals);\\n4. pq ∈ EG whenever p ∈ EG , q ∈ EG (concatenation)\\n5. p/q ∈ EG whenever p ∈ EG , q ∈ EG (choice);\\n6. !p ∈ EG whenever p ∈ EG (negation, or lookahead);\\n7. p ∗ ∈ EG whenever p ∈ EG (repetition).\\nAll constructs of PEG except for negation are direct analogues of constructs of the EBNF\\nform of CFG, but their semantics is always deterministic. So p ∗ repeats parsing of p until\\nfailure, and p/q always tries to parse p first, q is parsed only if p fails. For example, the\\nexpression ab/a consumes the input string ab entirely while a/ab only consumes its first\\ncharacter. The corresponding EBNF expressions ab | a and a | ab are equivalent, both can\\nmatch either a or ab from the input string. Negation !p tries to parse p and fails if p succeeds;\\n© Härmel Nestra;\\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY\\n\\n\f2\\n\\nAlignment Elimination from Adams’ Grammars\\n\\nif p fails then !p succeeds with consuming no input. Other constructs of EBNF like non-null\\nrepetition p + and optional occurrence [p] can be introduced to PEG as syntactic sugar.\\nLanguages like Python and Haskell allow the syntactic structure of programs to be\\nshown by indentation and alignment, instead of the more conventional braces and semicolons.\\nHandling indentation and alignment in Python has been specified in terms of extra tokens\\nINDENT and DEDENT that mark increasing and decreasing of indentation and must be\\ngenerated by the lexer. In Haskell, rules for handling indentation and alignment are more\\nsophisticated. Both these languages enable to locally use a different layout mode where\\nindentation does not matter, which additionally complicates the task of formal syntax\\nspecification. Adams and Ağacan [3] proposed an extension of PEG notation for specifying\\nindentation sensitivity and argued that it considerably simplifies this task for Python, Haskell\\nand many other indentation-sensitive languages.\\nIn this extension, expression p > , for example, denotes parsing of p while assuming a\\ngreater indentation than that of the surrounding block. In general, parsing expressions may\\nbe equipped with binary relations (as was > in the example) that must hold between the\\nbaselines of the local and the current indentation block. In addition, ¦p¦ denotes parsing of\\np while assuming the first token of the input being aligned, i.e., positioned on the current\\nindentation baseline. For example, the do expressions in Haskell can be specified by\\n<doexp>\\n<istmts>\\n<stmts>\\n\\n::=\\n::=\\n::=\\n\\ndo> (<istmts>/<stmts>)\\n+\\n(¦<stmt>¦ )>\\n>\\n{ (<stmt>(;<stmt>)∗ [;]})~\\n\\nHere, <istmts> and <stmts> stand for statement lists in the indentation and relaxed mode,\\nrespectively. In the indentation mode, a statement list is indented (marked by > in the\\nsecond production) and all statements in it are aligned (marked by ¦ · ¦). In the relaxed mode,\\nhowever, relation ~ is used to indicate that the indentation baseline of the contents can be\\nanything. (Technically, ~ is the binary relation containing all pairs of natural numbers.)\\nTerminals do and { are also equipped with > to meet the Haskell requirement that subsequent\\ntokens of aligned blocks must be indented more than the first token.\\nAlignment construct provides fulcra for disambiguating the often large variety of indentation baseline candidates. Besides simplicity of this grammar extension and its use, a strength\\nof it lies in the fact that grammars can still serve as parsers.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formally introduces additional\\nconstructs of PEG for specifying code layout, defines their semantics and studies their\\nsemantic properties. In Sect. 3, a semantics-preserving process of eliminating the alignment\\nconstruct from grammars is described. Section 4 refers to related work and Sect. 5 concludes.\\n\\n2\\n\\nIndentation extension of PEG\\n\\nAdams and Ağacan [3] extend PEGs with the indentation and alignment constructs. We\\npropose a slightly different extension with three rather than two extra constructs. Our\\napproach agrees with that implemented by Adams in his indentation package for Haskell [1],\\nwhence calling the grammars in our approach Adams’ grammars is justified. All differences\\nbetween the definitions in this paper and in [3] are listed and discussed in Subsect. 2.4.\\nLet N denote the set of all natural numbers, and let B = {tt, ff } (the Boolean domain).\\nDenote by ℘(X) the set of all subsets of set X, and let <(X) denote the set of all binary\\nrelations on set X, i.e., <(X) = ℘(X × X). Standard examples are >∈ <(N) (consisting\\nof all pairs (n, m) of natural numbers such that n > m) and 4 ∈ <(N) (the identity\\n\\n\fH. Nestra\\n\\nrelation consisting of all pairs of equal natural numbers); the indentation extension also\\nmakes use of ~ ∈ <(N) (the relation containing all pairs of natural numbers). Whenever\\nρ ∈ <(X) and Y ⊆ X, denote ρ(Y ) = {x ∈ X : ∃y ∈ Y.(y, x) ∈ ρ} (the image of Y under\\nrelation ρ). The inverse relation of ρ is defined by ρ−1 = {(x, y) : (y, x) ∈ ρ}, and the\\ncomposition of relations\\nσ and ρ by σ ◦ ρ = {(x, z) : ∃y.(x, y) ∈ σ ∧ (y, z) ∈ ρ}. Finally,\\\\ndenote <+ (X) = ρ ∈ <(X) : ∀x ∈ X.ρ−1 ({x}) 6= ∅ = {ρ ∈ <(X) : ρ(X) = X}.\\n\\n2.1\\n\\nAdams’ grammars\\n\\nExtend the definition of EG given in Sect. 1 with the following three additional clauses:\\n8. p ρ ∈ EG for every p ∈ EG and ρ ∈ <(N) (indentation);\\n9. p σ ∈ EG for every p ∈ EG and σ ∈ <(N) (token position);\\n10. ¦p¦ ∈ EG for every p ∈ EG (alignment).\\nParsing of an expression p ρ means parsing of p while assuming that the part of the input\\nstring corresponding to p forms a new indentation block whose baseline is in relation ρ to\\nthe baseline of the surrounding block. (Baselines are identified with column numbers.) The\\nposition construct p σ , missing in [3], determines how tokens of the input can be situated w.r.t.\\nthe current indentation baseline. Finally, parsing an expression ¦p¦ means parsing of p while\\nassuming the first token of the input being positioned on the current indentation baseline\\n(unlike the position operator, this construct does not affect processing the subsequent tokens).\\nInspired by the indentation package [1], we call the relations that determine token\\npositioning w.r.t. the indentation baseline token modes. In the token mode > for example,\\ntokens may appear only to the right of the indentation baseline. Applying the position\\noperator with relation > to parts of Haskell grammar to be parsed in the indentation mode\\navoids indenting every single terminal in the example in Sect. 1. Also, indenting terminals\\nwith > is inadequate for do expressions occurring inside a block of relaxed mode but the\\nposition construct can be easily used to change the token mode for such blocks (e.g., to ≥).\\nWe call a PEG extended with these three constructs a PEG> . Recall from Sect. 1 that N\\nand T denote the set of non-terminal and terminal symbols of the grammar, respectively, and\\nδ : N → EG is the production function. Concerning the semantics of PEG> , each expression\\nparses an input string of terminals (w ∈ T ∗ ) in the context of a current set of indentation\\nbaseline candidates (I ∈ ℘(N)) and a current alignment flag indicating whether the next\\nterminal should be aligned or not (b ∈ B), assuming a certain token mode (τ ∈ <(N)).\\nParsing may succeed, fail, or diverge. If parsing succeeds, it returns as a result a new triple\\ncontaining the rest of the input w0 , a new set I 0 of baseline candidates updated according to\\nthe information gathered during parsing, and a new alignment flag b0 . This result is denoted\\nby >(w0 , I 0 , b0 ). If parsing fails, there is no result in a triple form; failure is denoted by ⊥.\\nTriples of the form (w, I, b) ∈ T ∗ × ℘(N) × B are behaving as operation states of parsing, as\\neach parsing step may use these data and update them. We will write State = T ∗ × ℘(N) × B\\n(as we never deal with different terminal sets, dependence on T is not explicitly marked),\\nand denote by State + 1 the set of possible results of parsing, i.e., {>(s) : s ∈ State} ∪ {⊥}.\\nThe assertion that parsing expression e in grammar G with input string w in the context\\nof I and b assuming token mode τ results in o ∈ State + 1 is denoted by e, τ `G (w, I, b) → o.\\nThe formal definition below must be interpreted inductively, i.e., an assertion of the form\\nG, τ `e s → o is valid iff it has a finite derivation by the following ten rules:\\n1. ε, τ `G s → >(s).\\n2.

For\\nthe same reason, consuming a token in column i restricts the set of allowed indentations\\nto τ({i}) or {i} depending on the alignment flag. In both cases, the alignment flag is set\\nto ff . In clause 8 for p ρ , the set I of allowed indentation is replaced by ρ−1 (I) as the local\\nindentation baseline must be in relation ρ with the current indentation baseline known to be\\nin I. After successful parsing of p with the resulting set of allowed local indentations being\\nI 0 , the set of allowed indentations of the surrounding block is restricted to ρ(I 0 ). Clause 10\\nsimilarly operates on the alignment flag.\\n>\\nFor a toy example, consider parsing of ¦ab¦ with the operation state (a2 b3 , N, ff ) assuming\\nthe token mode ≥. For that, we must parse ¦ab¦ with (a2 b3 , N \\ {0} , ff ) by clause 8 since\\n>−1 (N) = N \\ {0}. For that in turn, we must parse ab with (a2 b3 , N \\ {0} , tt) by clause\\n10. By clause 2, we have a, ≥ `G (a2 b3 , N \\ {0} , tt) → >(b3 , {2} , ff ) (as 2 ∈ N \\ {0}) and\\nb, ≥ `G (b3 , {2} , ff ) → >(ε, {2} , ff ) (as (2, 3) ∈ ≥−1 ). Therefore, by clause 4, ab, ≥ `G\\n(a2 b3 , N \\ {0} , tt) → >(ε, {2} , ff ). Finally, ¦ab¦, ≥ `G (a2 b3 , N \\ {0} , ff ) → >(ε, {2} , ff ) and\\n>\\n¦ab¦ , ≥ `G (a2 b3 , N, ff ) → >(ε, {0, 1} , ff ) by clauses 10 and 8. The set {0, 1} in the final\\nstate shows that only 0 and 1 are still candidates for the indentation baseline outside the\\nparsed part of the input (before parsing, the candidate set was the whole N).\\nNote that this definition involves circular dependencies. For instance, if δ(X) = X for\\nsome X ∈ N then X, τ `G s → o if X, τ `G s → o by clause 3. There is no result of parsing\\nin such cases (not even ⊥). We call this behaviour divergence.\\n\\n\fH. Nestra\\n\\n2.2\\n\\n5\\n\\nProperties of the semantics\\n\\nFord [6] proves that parsing in PEG is unambiguous, whereby the consumed part of an input\\nstring always is its prefix.

For many properties, proofs that rely on this abstract common definition can be\\ncarried out, assuming that γ is monotone, preserves the largest element and follows together\\nwith α the axiom x ∧ γ(y) ≤ γ(α(x) ∧ y). The class of all meet semilattices L with top\\nelement, equipped with mappings α, γ satisfying these three conditions, contains identities\\n(i.e., semilattices L with α = γ = idL ) and is closed under compositions (of different α,\\nγ defined on the same semilattice L) and under direct products. If ρ ∈ <+ (N) then the\\nconditions hold for α1 , γ1 : ℘(N) → ℘(N) with α1 (I) = ρ−1 (I), γ1 (I) = ρ(I), similarly in the\\ncase if α2 , γ2 : B → B with α2 (b) = tt, γ2 (b) = b. Now the direct product of the identities of\\nT ∗ and B with (α1 , γ1 ) on ℘(N) gives the indentation case, and the direct product of the\\nidentities of T ∗ and ℘(N) and the Boolean lattice B with (α2 , γ2 ) gives the alignment case.\\nIf α, γ satisfy the conditions then γ(α(x)) ≥ x since x = x∧> = x∧γ(>) ≤ γ(α(x)∧>) =\\nγ(α(x)). Adding dual conditions (α monotone, α(⊥) = ⊥ and α(x) ∨ y ≥ α(x ∨ γ(y))) would\\nmake (α, γ) a Galois’ connection. In our cases, the dual axioms do not hold.\\n\\n2.3\\n\\nSemantic equivalence\\n\\nI Definition 2.2. Let G = (N, T, δ, s) be a PEG> and p, q ∈ EG . We say that p and q are\\nsemantically equivalent in G and denote p ∼G q iff p, τ `G s → o ⇐⇒ q, τ `G s → o for\\nevery τ ∈ <+ (N), s ∈ State and o ∈ State + 1.\\nFor example, one can easily prove that pε ∼G p ∼G εp, p(qr ) ∼G (pq)r , p/(q/r ) ∼G\\n(p/q)/r , p(q/r ) ∼G pq/pr , p/q ∼G p/!pq for all p, q, r ∈ EG [6]. We are particularly\\ninterested in equivalences involving the additional operators of PEG> . In Sect. 3, they will\\nbe useful in eliminating alignment and position operators. The following Theorem 2.3 states\\ndistributivity laws of the three new operators of PEG> w.r.t. other constructs:\\nI Theorem 2.3. Let G = (N, T, δ, s) be a PEG> .

The equivalences in claim 1 hold as the token mode steadily distributes to each case\\nof the semantics definition. Those in claims 2 and 3 have straightforward proofs using the\\njoint form of the semantics of indentation and alignment and the axioms of α, γ.\\nJ\\nNote that indentation does not distribute with concatenation, i.e., (pq)ρ \u001cG p ρ q ρ .\\nThis is because (pq)ρ assumes one indentation block with a baseline common to p and\\nq while p ρ q ρ tolerates different baselines for p and q. For example, take p = a ∈ T ,\\nq = b ∈ T , let the token mode be 4 and the input state be (a1 b2 , N, ff ) (recall that ai means\\nterminal a occurring in column i). We have a, 4 `G (a1 b2 , N \\ {0} , ff ) → >(b2 , {1} , ff )\\nand b, 4 `G (b2 , {1} , ff ) → ⊥ (since (2, 1) ∈\\n/ 4), therefore ab, 4 `G (a1 b2 , N \\ {0} , ff ) → ⊥\\n>\\n1 2\\nand (ab) , 4 `G (a b , N, ff ) → ⊥. On the other hand, a, 4 `G (a1 b2 , N \\ {0} , ff ) →\\n>(b2 , {1} , ff ) implies a> , 4 `G (a1 b2 , N, ff ) → >(b2 , {0} , ff ) (since N ∩ (> ({1})) = {0})\\nand, analogously, b> , 4 `G (b2 , {0} , ff ) → >(ε, {0} , ff ) (since >−1 ({0}) = N \\ {0} 3 2 and\\n{0} ∩ (> ({2})) = {0}). Consequently, a> b> , 4 `G (a1 b2 , N, ff ) → >(ε, {0} , ff ).\\nWe can however prove the following facts:\\nI Theorem 2.4. Let G = (N, T, δ, s) be a PEG> .\\n1.

Straightforward case study.\\n\\n2.4\\n\\nJ\\n\\nDifferences of our approach from previous work\\n\\nOur specification of PEG> differs from the definition used by Adams and Ağacan [3] by three\\nessential aspects listed below. The last two discrepancies can be understood as bugs in the\\noriginal description that have been corrected in the Haskell indentation package by Adams\\n[1]. This package also provides means for locally changing the token mode. All in all, our\\nmodifications fully agree with the indentation package.\\n1. The position operator p σ is missing in [3]. The treatment there assumes just one default\\ntoken mode applying to the whole grammar, whence token positions deviating from the\\ndefault must be specified using the indentation operator. The benefits of the position\\noperator were shortly discussed in Subsect. 2.1.\\n2. According to the grammar semantics provided in [3], the alignment flag is never changed\\nat the end of parsing of an expression of the form ¦p¦. This is not appropriate if p\\nsucceeds without consuming any token, as the alignment flag would unexpectedly remain\\ntrue during parsing of the next token that is out of scope of the alignment operator. The\\nvalue the alignment flag had before starting parsing ¦p¦ should be restored in this case.\\nThis is the purpose of conjunction in the alignment semantics described in this paper.\\n\\n\f8\\n\\nAlignment Elimination from Adams’ Grammars\\n\\n3. In [3], an alignment is interpreted w.r.t. the indentation baseline of the block that\\ncorresponds to the parsing expression to which the alignment operator is applied.\\nIndentation operators occurring inside this expression and processed while the alignment\\nflag is true are neglected. In the semantics described in our paper, raising the alignment\\nflag does not suppress new indentations. Alignments are interpreted w.r.t. the indentation\\nbaseline in force at the aligned token site. This seems more appropriate than the former\\napproach where the indentations cancelled because of an alignment do not apply even to\\nthe subsequent non-aligned tokens. Distributivity of indentation and alignment fails in\\nthe semantics of [3]. Note that alignment of a block nevertheless suppresses the influence\\nof position operators whose scope extend over the first token of the block.\\nOur grammar semantics has also two purely formal deviations from the semantics used\\nby Adams and Ağacan [3] and Ford [6].\\n1. We keep track of the rest of the input in the operation state while both [3, 6] expose the\\nconsumed part of the input instead. This difference was introduced for simplicity and\\nto achieve uniform decreasing of operation states in Theorem 2.1.\\n2. We do not have explicit step counts. They were used in [6] to compose proofs by\\ninduction. We provide analogous proofs by induction on the shape of derivation trees.\\n\\n3\\n\\nElimination of alignment and position operators\\n\\nAdams [2] describes alignment elimination in the context of CFGs. In [3], Adams and\\nAğacan claim that alignment elimination process for PEGs is more difficult due to the\\nlookahead construct. To our knowledge, no concrete process of semantics-preserving alignment\\nelimination is described for PEGs before. We provide one below for well-formed grammars.\\nWe rely on the existence of position operators in the grammar; this is not an issue since we\\nalso show that position operators can be eliminated from alignment-free grammars.\\n\\n3.1\\n\\nApproximation semantics and well-formed expressions\\n\\nFor defining well-formedness, we first need to introduce approximation semantics that consists\\nof assertions of the form e *G n where e ∈ EG and n ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. This semantics is a\\ndecidable extension of the predicate that tells whether parsing of e may succeed with\\nconsuming no input (result 0), succeed with consuming some input (result 1) or fail (result\\n−1). No particular input strings, indentation sets etc. are involved, whence the semantics is\\nnot deterministic. The following set of clauses define the approximation semantics inductively.\\nε *G 0.\\nFor every a ∈ T , a *G 1 and a *G −1.\\nFor every X ∈ N , X *G n if δ(X) *G n.\\nFor every p, q ∈ EG , pq *G n holds in four cases:\\np *G 0, q *G 0 and n = 0;\\nThere exist n0 , n00 ∈ {0, 1} such that p *G n0 , q *G n00 , 1 ∈ {n0 , n00 } and n = 1;\\nThere exists n0 ∈ {0, 1} such that p *G n0 , q *G −1 and n = −1;\\np *G −1 and n = −1.\\n5.

This is sound\\nsince if parsing of p never fails then parsing of p ∗ cannot terminate. The difference does not\\nmatter in the grammar transformations below as they assume repetition-free grammars.\\nI Theorem 3.1. Let G = (N, T, δ, s) be a PEG> . Assume that e, τ `G s → o for some\\nτ ∈ <(N) and s ∈ State, o ∈ State + 1. Then:\\n1. If o = >(s) then e *G 0;\\n2. If o = >(s0 ) for some s0 6= s then e *G 1;\\n3. If o = ⊥ then e *G −1.\\nProof. By induction on the shape of the derivation tree of the assertion e, τ `G s → o.\\n\\nJ\\n\\nWell-formedness is a decidable conservative approximation of the predicate that is true\\niff parsing in G never diverges (it definitely excludes grammars with left recursion but can\\nexclude also some safe grammars). Well-formedness of PEGs was introduced by Ford [6].\\nThe following set of clauses is an inductive definition of predicate WF G , well-formedness of\\nexpressions, for PEG> :\\n1. ε ∈ WF G ;\\n2. For every a ∈ T , a ∈ WF G ;\\n3. For every X ∈ N , X ∈ WF G if δ(X) ∈ WF G ;\\n4. For every p, q ∈ EG , pq ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G and, in addition, p *G 0 implies q ∈ WF G ;\\n5. For every p, q ∈ EG , p/q ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G and, in addition, p *G −1 implies\\nq ∈ WF G ;\\n6. For every p ∈ EG , !p ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G ;\\n7. For every p ∈ EG , p ∗ ∈ WF G if p 6*G 0 and p ∈ WF G ;\\n8. For every p ∈ EG and ρ ∈ <+ (N), p ρ ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G ;\\n9. For every p ∈ EG and σ ∈ <+ (N), p σ ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G ;\\n10. For every p ∈ EG , ¦p¦ ∈ WF G if p ∈ WF G .\\nThis definition rejects non-terminals with directly or indirectly left recursive rules since\\nfor a concatenation pq to be well-formed, p must be well-formed, leading to an infinite\\nderivation in the case of any kind of left recursion. On the other hand, requiring both\\np ∈ WF G and q ∈ WF G in the clause for pq ∈ WF G would be too restrictive since this\\nwould reject non-terminals with meaningful recursive productions like X 7→ aX/ε.\\nAgain, clauses for PEG constructs (1–7) mostly copy the definition given by Ford [6].\\nThis time, the choice case is an exception. In [6], p/q is considered well-formed only if both\\np and q are well-formed, which needlessly rejects non-terminals with safe recursive rules like\\nX 7→ ε/X. We require q ∈ WF G only if q could possibly be executed, i.e. if p *G −1.\\nA grammar G = (N, T, δ, s) is called well-formed if p ∈ WF G for every expression p\\noccurring as a subexpression in some δ(X) or s. Ford [6] proves by induction on the length\\n\\n\f10\\n\\nAlignment Elimination from Adams’ Grammars\\n\\nof the input string that, in well-formed grammars, parsing of every expression whose all\\nsubexpressions are well-formed terminates on every input string. We can prove an analogous\\nresult in a similar way but we prefer to generalize the statement to a stricter semantics which\\nenables to occasionally construct easier proofs later. The new semantics, which we call strict,\\nis defined by replacing the choice clause in the definition of Subsect. 2.1 with the following:\\n5. For every p, q ∈ EG , p/q, τ `G s → o holds in two cases:\\nThere exists a triple s0 such that p, τ `G s → >(s0 ), o = >(s0 ) and, in addition,\\np *G −1 implies q, τ `G s → o0 for some o0 ∈ State + 1;\\np, τ `G s → ⊥ and q, τ `G s → o.\\nThe new semantics is more restrictive since, to finish parsing of an expression of the form\\np/q after parsing p successfully, also q must be parsed if p *G −1 happens to be the case.\\nIn the standard semantics, parsing of p/q does not have to try q if parsing of p is successful.\\nSo, if parsing of an expression terminates in the strict semantics then it terminates with the\\nsame result in the standard semantics (but not necessarily vice versa). Therefore proving\\nthat parsing always gives a result in the strict semantics will establish this also for the\\nstandard semantics. In the rest, we sign strict semantics with exclamation mark, i.e., parsing\\nassertions will be of the form e, τ `! G s → o.\\nI Theorem 3.2. Let G = (N, T, δ, s) be a well-formed PEG> and let e ∈ EG . Assume that\\nall subexpressions of e are well-formed. Then for every τ ∈ <+ (N) and s ∈ State, there exists\\no ∈ State + 1 such that e, τ `! G s → o.\\nProof. By induction on the length of the input string (i.e., the first component of s). The\\ninduction step uses induction on the shape of the derivation tree of the assertion e ∈ WF G . J\\n\\n3.2\\n\\nSplitting\\n\\nAs the repetition operator can always be eliminated (by adding a new non-terminal Ap with\\nδ(Ap ) = pAp /ε for each subexpression p that occurs under the star operator), we may assume\\nthat the input grammar G is repetition-free. The first stage of our process also assumes that\\nG is well-formed, all negations are applied to atomic expressions, and all choices are disjoint.\\nA choice expression p/q is called disjoint if parsing of p and q cannot succeed in the same\\ninput state and token mode. Achieving the last two preconditions can be considered as a\\npreparatory and previously studied (e.g. in [6] as stage 1 of negation elimination) step of the\\nprocess. Issues concerning this are discussed briefly in Subsect. 3.5.\\nWe use in principle the same splitting algorithm as in stage 2 of the negation elimination\\nprocess described by Ford [6], adding clauses for the extra operators in PEG> . The approach\\ndefines two functions γ0 : WF G → EG and γ1 : EG → EG as follows (F is a metavariable\\ndenoting any expression that always fails, e.g., !ε):\\nγ0 (ε)\\nγ0 (a)\\nγ0 (X)\\nγ0 (pq)\\nγ0 (p/q)\\nγ0 (!p)\\nγ0 (p ρ )\\nγ0 (p σ )\\nγ0 (¦p¦)\\n\\n=ε\\n= F\\n= γ0 (δ(X))\\n\u001a\\n\u001b\\nγ0 (p)γ0 (q) if p *G 0\\n=\\nF\\notherwise\\n\u001a\\n\u001b\\nγ0 (p)/γ0 (q) if p *G −1\\n=\\nγ0 (p)\\notherwise\\n= !(γ1 (p)/γ0 (p))\\n= (γ0 (p))ρ\\n= (γ0 (p))σ\\n= ¦γ0 (p)¦\\n\\nγ1 (ε)\\nγ1 (a)\\nγ1 (X)\\n\\n=F\\n= a\\n=X\\n\\nγ1 (pq) = γ1 (p)γ1 (q)/γ1 (p)γ0 (q)/γ0 (p)γ1 (q)\\n\u001a\\n\u001b\\nγ1 (p)/γ1 (q) if p *G −1\\nγ1 (p/q) =\\nγ1 (p)\\notherwise\\nγ1 (!p) = F\\nγ1 (p ρ ) = (γ1 (p))ρ\\nγ1 (p σ ) = (γ1 (p))σ\\nγ1 (¦p¦) = ¦γ1 (p)¦\\n\\n\fH. Nestra\\n\\n11\\n\\nCorrectness of the definition of γ0 follows by induction on the shape of the derivation\\ntree of the assertion e ∈ WF G . In the negation case, we use that negations are applied to\\natomic expressions, whence the reference to γ1 can be eliminated by a replacement from its\\ndefinition. The definition of γ1 is sound by induction on the shape of the expression e.\\nA new grammar G0 = (N, T, δ0 , s 0 ) is defined using γ0 , γ1 by equations δ0 (X) = γ1 (δ(X)),\\n0\\ns = γ1 (s)/γ0 (s). The equivalence of the input and output grammars relies on the splitting\\ninvariant established by Theorem 3.3 below which allows instead of each parsing expression e\\nwith negations in front of atoms and disjoint choices in G to equivalently use parsing\\nexpression γ1 (e)/γ0 (e) in G0 . The claim is analogous to the splitting invariant used by [6]\\nbut we can provide a simpler proof using the strict semantics (an analogous proof using the\\nstandard semantics would fail in the choice case).\\nI Theorem 3.3. Let e, τ `G s → o where e ∈ EG , τ ∈ <+ (N) and s ∈ State, o ∈ State + 1.\\nAssuming that all choices in the rules of G and expression e are disjoint and the negations\\nare applied to atoms, the following holds:\\n1. If o = >(s) then γ0 (e), τ `G0 s → >(s) and γ1 (e), τ `G0 s → ⊥;\\n2. If o = >(s0 ) where s0 6= s then γ0 (e), τ `G0 s → ⊥ and γ1 (e), τ `G0 s → >(s0 );\\n3. If o = ⊥ then γ0 (e), τ `G0 s → ⊥ and γ1 (e), τ `G0 s → ⊥.\\nProof. We don’t use the repetition operator, whence all expressions in well-formed grammars\\nare well-formed (this fact follows from an easy induction on the expression structure). By\\nTheorems 3.2 and 2.1, e, τ `! G s → o. The desired result follows by induction of the shape of\\nthe derivation tree of e, τ `! G s → o, using the disjointness assumption in the choice case. J\\nAs the result of this transformation, the sizes of the right-hand sides of the productions\\ncan grow exponentially though the number of productions stays unchanged. Preprocessing\\nthe grammar via introducing new non-terminals in such a way that all concatenations were\\napplied to atoms (similarly to Ford [6]) would hinder the growth, but the size in the worst\\ncase remains exponential. The subsequent transformations cause at most a linear growth of\\nright-hand sides.\\n\\n3.3\\n\\nAlignment elimination\\n\\nIn a grammar G = (N, T, δ, s) obtained via splitting, we can eliminate alignments using the\\nfollowing three steps:\\n1. Introduce a copy X 0 of each non-terminal X and define δ(X 0 ) = ¦δ(X)¦.\\n2. In all right-hand sides of productions and the start expression, apply distributivity laws\\n(Theorem 2.3 (3), Theorem 2.4 (3), Theorem 2.5) and idempotence (Theorem 2.4 (4)) to\\nbring all alignment operators down to terminals and non-terminals. Replace alignment\\nof terminals by position (Theorem 2.4 (6)).\\n3. In all right-hand sides of productions and the start expression, replace all subexpressions\\nof the form ¦X¦ with the corresponding new non-terminal X 0 .\\nFor establishing the equivalence of the original and the obtained grammar, the following\\ngeneral theorem can be used.\\nI Theorem 3.4. Let G1 = (N, T, δ1 , s 1 ) and G2 = (N, T, δ2 , s 2 ) be PEG> s. If for every\\nX ∈ N , δ1 (X) ∼G1 δ2 (X) then e, τ `G2 s → o always implies e, τ `G1 s → o.\\nProof. Easy induction on the shape of the derivation tree of e, τ `G2 s → o.\\n\\nJ\\n\\n\f12\\n\\nAlignment Elimination from Adams’ Grammars\\n\\nDenote by φ the function defined on EG that performs transformations of steps 2–3, i.e.,\\ndistributes alignment operators to the non-terminals and replaces aligned non-terminals with\\ncorresponding new non-terminals. Denote by G0 the grammar obtained after step 3. Note that\\nstep 1 does not change the semantics of expressions written in the original grammar. Steps\\n2 and 3 replace the right-hand sides of productions with expressions that are semantically\\nequivalent with them in the grammar obtained after step 1. By Theorem 3.4, this implies\\nthat whenever parsing of some e ∈ EG in the final grammar G0 produces some result then\\nthe same result is obtained when parsing e with the same input state and token mode in the\\noriginal grammar G. In order to be able to apply Theorem 3.4 with grammars interchanged,\\nwe need the equivalence of the right-hand sides of productions also in grammar G0 . For this,\\nit is sufficient to show ¦X¦ ∼G0 X 0 for every X ∈ N , which in turn would follow from the\\nstatement ¦φ(δ(X))¦ ∼G0 φ(¦δ(X)¦). Consequently, the equivalence of the initial and final\\ngrammars is implied by the following theorem.\\nI Theorem 3.5. For every e ∈ EG , φ(¦e¦) ∼G0 ¦φ(e)¦.\\nProof. The claim is a direct consequence of the following two lemmas, both holding for\\narbitrary s ∈ State, o ∈ State + 1:\\nIf φ(¦e¦), τ `G0 s → o then ¦φ(e)¦, τ `G0 s → o and ¦φ(¦e¦)¦, τ `G0 s → o;\\nIf ¦φ(e)¦, τ `G0 s → o or ¦φ(¦e¦)¦, τ `G0 s → o then φ(¦e¦), τ `G0 s → o.\\nBoth lemmas are proven by induction on the shape of derivation trees. The assertion with two\\nalignments (both outside and inside) is needed in the case where e itself is of the form ¦p¦. J\\n\\n3.4\\n\\nElimination of position operators\\n\\nIn an alignment-free PEG> G = (N, T, δ, s), we can get rid of position operations using a\\nprocess largely analogous to the alignment elimination, consisting of the following four steps:\\n1. Introduce a new non-terminal hX, τi for each existing non-terminal X and relation τ\\nused by a position operator, with δ(hX, τi) = (δ(X))τ .\\n2. Apply distributivity laws (Theorem 2.3 (1)) and cancellation (Theorem 2.4 (5)) to bring\\nall position operators down to terminals and non-terminals.\\n3. Replace all subexpressions of the form Xτ with corresponding new non-terminals hX, τi.\\n4. Replace all subexpressions of the form aτ with aτ .\\nAgain, denote by φ the function defined on EG that performs transformations of steps\\n2–3, i.e., distributes position operators to the terminals and non-terminals and replaces\\nnon-terminals under position operators with corresponding new non-terminals. Denote by G0\\nthe grammar obtained after step 3. Theorem 3.4 applies here as well, whence the equivalence\\nof the grammar obtained after step 3 and the initial grammar is implied by the following\\nTheorem 3.6.\\nI Theorem 3.6. For every e ∈ EG and σ ∈ <+ (N), φ(e σ ) ∼G0 (φ(e))σ .\\nProof. The claim is a direct consequence of the following two lemmas, both holding for\\narbitrary s ∈ State, o ∈ State + 1 and τ, υ ∈ <+ (N):\\nIf φ(e σ ), τ `G0 s → o then (φ(e))σ , τ `G0 s → o and (φ(e σ ))υ , τ `G0 s → o;\\nIf (φ(e))σ , τ `G0 s → o or (φ(e σ ))υ , τ `G0 s → o then φ(e σ ), τ `G0 s → o.\\nBoth lemmas are proven by induction on the shape of the derivation trees. The claim with\\nposition operator both outside and inside ((φ(e σ ))υ ) is needed in the case when e itself is an\\napplication of the position operator.\\nJ\\n\\n\fH. Nestra\\n\\nCorrectness of step 4 can be proven by induction on the shape of the derivation trees,\\nusing Theorem 2.6. Note that here we must assume that parsing according to the final\\ngrammar is performed with the alignment flag false (a natural assumption as the grammar is\\nalignment-free) and the token mode 4.\\n\\n3.5\\n\\nDiscussion on the preconditions\\n\\nAlignment elimination was correctly defined under the assumption that the input grammar\\nis well-formed, has negations only in front of atoms, and disjoint choices (all these conditions\\nare needed at stage 1 only). The second assumption can be easily established by introducing\\na new non-terminal for each expression p such that !p occurs in the productions or in the\\nstart expression. This can be done in the lines of the first stage of the negation elimination\\nprocess described by Ford [6]. This transformation preserves well-formedness of the grammar.\\nAchieving disjoint choices is a more subtle topic. A straightforward way would be replacing\\nchoices of the form p/q with disjoint choices p/!pq which seems to work well as p/q and\\np/!pq are equivalent in the standard semantics.\\nAlas, p/q and p/!pq are not equivalent in the approximation semantics, because if\\np *G 1, p *G −1, q *G 0 but q 6*G −1, then p/!pq *G −1 while p/q 6*G −1. Due\\nto this, replacing p/q with p/!pq can break well-formedness. Take X ∈ N such that\\nδ(X) =!(a/ε)X. Then X ∈ WF G due to !(a/ε) ∈ WF G alone, no recursive call to X ∈ WF G\\narises as !(a/ε) 6*G 0. However, if δ0 (X) =!(a/!aε)X in G0 then !(a/!aε) *G0 0 whence\\nwell-formedness of X now recursively requires well-formedness of X. Thus X ∈\\n/ WF G0 . (An\\nargument similar to this shows that the first stage of the negation elimination process in\\nFord [6] also can break well-formedness. As the second stage is correctly defined only for\\nwell-formed grammars, the whole process fails.)\\nOne solution would be changing the approximation semantics by adding, to the inductive\\ndefinition in Subsect. 3.1, a general clause\\n0. e *G −1 if e *G 0 or e *G 1.\\nThis forces e *G −1 to hold whenever an assertion of the form e *G n holds, and in\\nparticular, p/q becomes equivalent to p/!pq. Then replacing p/q with p/!pq preserves\\nwell-formedness. Although well-formedness predicate becomes more restrictive and rejects\\nmore safe grammars, the loss seems to be little and acceptable in practice (expressions q\\nsuch that q *G 0 or q *G 1 while q 6*G −1 seem to occur not very commonly in influenced\\nproductions such as X 7→!(p/q)X, but a further investigation is needed to clarify this).\\n\\n4\\n\\nRelated work\\n\\nPEGs were first introduced and studied by Ford [6] who also showed them to be closely\\nrelated with the TS system [5] and TDPL [4], as well as to their generalized forms [5, 4].\\nAdams [2] and Adams and Ağacan [3] provide an excellent overview of previous approaches\\nto describing indentation-sensitive languages and attempts of building indentation features\\ninto parser libraries. Our work is a theoretical study of the approach proposed in [3] while\\nsome details of the semantics used in our paper were “corrected” in the lines of Adams’\\nindentation package for Haskell [1]. This package enables specifying indentation sensitivity\\nwithin the Parsec and Trifecta parser combinator libraries. A process of alignment operator\\nelimination is previously described for CFGs by Adams [2].\\nMatsumura and Kuramitsu [7] develop a very general extension of PEG that also enables\\nto specify indentation. Their framework is powerful but complicated. The approach proposed\\n\\n13\\n\\n\f14\\n\\nAlignment Elimination from Adams’ Grammars\\n\\nin [3] and followed by us is in contrast with [7] by focusing on indentation and aiming to\\nmaximal simplicity and convenience of usage.\\n\\n5\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nWe studied the extension of PEG proposed by Adams and Ağacan [3] for indentationsensitive parsing. This extension uses operators for marking indentation and alignment\\nbesides the classic ones. Having added one more operator (position) for convenience, we\\nfound a lot of useful semantic equivalences that are valid on expressions written in the\\nextended grammars. We applied these equivalences subsequently for defining a process that\\nalgorithmically eliminates all alignment and position operators from well-formed grammars.\\nReferences\\n1\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n5\\n\\n6\\n\\n7\\n\\n8\\n\\nMichael D.
